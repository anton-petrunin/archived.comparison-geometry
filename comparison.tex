\section{Model triangles and angles}

Recall that a shortest path between points $x$ and $y$ in a surface $\Sigma$ will be denoted as $[xy]$ or $[xy]_\Sigma$, and
$|x-y|_\Sigma$ denotes the \index{intrinsic distance}\emph{intrinsic distance} from $x$ to $y$ in $\Sigma$.

A \index{geodesic triangle}\emph{geodesic triangle} in a surface $\Sigma$ is defined as a triple of points $x,y,z\in \Sigma$ with choice of minimizing geodesics $[xy]_\Sigma$, $[yz]_\Sigma$ and $[zx]_\Sigma$.
The points $x,y,z$ are called {}\emph{vertexes} of the geodesic triangle,
the minimizing geodesics $[xy]$, $[yz]$ and $[zx]$ are called its {}\emph{sides};
the triangle itself is denoted by $[xyz]$, or by $[xyz]_\Sigma$, if we need to emphasize that it lies in $\Sigma$.

A triangle $[\tilde x\tilde y\tilde z]$ in the plane $\RR^2$ is called \index{model triangle}\emph{model triangle} of the triangle $[xyz]$,
briefly $[\tilde x\tilde y\tilde z]=\tilde\triangle xyz$,
\index{$\tilde\triangle$}
if its corresponding sides are equal;
that is,
\[|\tilde x-\tilde y|_{\RR^2}=|x-y|_\Sigma,
\quad
|\tilde y-\tilde z|_{\RR^2}=|y-z|_\Sigma,
\quad
|\tilde z-\tilde x|_{\RR^2}=|z-x|_\Sigma.
\]

A pair of minimizing geodesics $[xy]$ and $[xz]$ starting from one point $x$ is called \index{hinge}\emph{hinge} and denoted as $\hinge xyz$.\index{$\hinge xyz$}
The angle between these geodesics at $x$ is denoted by $\measuredangle\hinge xyz$.
The corresponding angle $\measuredangle\hinge {\tilde x}{\tilde y}{\tilde z}$ in the model triangle $[\tilde x\tilde y\tilde z]=\tilde\triangle xyz$ is denoted by $\angk xyz$.

\section{Formulations}

Part \textit{\ref{SHORT.thm:comp:toponogov}} of the following theorem is called \index{Toponogov comparison theorem}\emph{Toponogov comparison theorem} and sometimes \index{Alexandrov comparison theorem}\emph{Alexandrov comparison theorem};
it was proved by Paolo Pizzetti \cite{pizzetti} and latter independently by Alexandr Alexandrov \cite{alexandrov}; 
generalizations were obtained by  Victor Toponogov \cite{toponogov1957}, Mikhael Gromov, Yuri Burago and Grigory Perelman \cite{burago-gromov-perelman}.

Part \textit{\ref{SHORT.thm:comp:cat}} is called \index{Cartan--Hadamard theorem}\emph{Cartan--Hadamard theorem};
it was proved by 
Hans von Mangoldt \cite{mangoldt} and generalized by Elie Cartan \cite{cartan}, Jacques Hadamard \cite{hadamard},
Herbert Busemann \cite{busemann},
Willi Rinow \cite{rinow},
Mikhael Gromov \cite[p.~119]{gromov},
Stephanie Alexander and Richard Bishop \cite{alexander-bishop1990}.

Recall that a surface $\Sigma$ is called {}\emph{simply connected} if any closed simple curve in $\Sigma$ bounds a disc.

\begin{thm}{Comparison theorems}\label{thm:comp}
Let $\Sigma$ be a proper smooth regular surface.

\begin{subthm}{thm:comp:toponogov}
If $\Sigma$ has nonnegative Gauss curvature, then 
 \[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}\ge\angk xyz\]
for any geodesic triangle $[xyz]$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{thm:comp:cat}
If $\Sigma$ is simply connected and has nonpositive Gauss curvature,
 then 
\[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}\le\angk xyz\]
for any geodesic triangle $[xyz]$.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

The proof of part \ref{SHORT.thm:comp:cat} will be given at the end of Section~\ref{sec:loc-comp}.
The proof of part \ref{SHORT.thm:comp:toponogov} will be finished in  Section~\ref{sec:nonneg-comp}.

Note that without condition that $\Sigma$ is simply connected, the statement \ref{SHORT.thm:comp:cat} does not hold.
For example the equator $z=0$ of the hyperboloid (which is not simply connected)
\[\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{x^2+y^2-z^2=1}\]
forms a triangle with all angles $\pi$, which contradict the comparison in~\ref{SHORT.thm:comp:cat}.

Let us discuss the relations between Gauss--Bonnet formula and the comparison theorems.
Suppose that a disc $\Delta$ is bounded by a geodesic triangle $[xyz]$ with internal angles $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$.
Then Gauss--Bonnet implies that 
\[\alpha+\beta+\gamma-\pi=\iint_\Delta K;\]
in particular in particular right and left hand sides have the same sign.
It follows that
\begin{itemize}
\item if $K_\Sigma\ge 0$ then $\alpha+\beta+\gamma\ge\pi$, and
\item if $K_\Sigma\le 0$ then $\alpha+\beta+\gamma\le\pi$.
\end{itemize}

Set 
\begin{align*}
\hat \alpha&=\min\{\,\alpha,2\cdot\pi-\alpha\,\},
\\
\hat\beta &=\min\{\,\beta,2\cdot\pi-\beta\,\},
\\
\hat\gamma&=\min\{\,\gamma,2\cdot\pi-\gamma\,\}.
\end{align*}
Note that, $\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}=\hat\alpha$,
$\measuredangle\hinge {y}{z}{x}=\hat\beta$,
and $\measuredangle\hinge {z}{x}{y}=\hat\gamma$.
Since the angles of any plane triangle sum up to $\pi$, from the comparison theorems, we get that
\begin{itemize}
\item if $K_\Sigma\ge 0$ then $\hat\alpha+\hat\beta+\hat\gamma\ge\pi$, and
\item if $K_\Sigma\le 0$ then $\hat\alpha+\hat\beta+\hat\gamma\le\pi$.
\end{itemize}

It shows that relation between Gauss--Bonnet and comparisons is not straightforward.
For example, Gauss--Bonnet theorem does not forbid the internal angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ to be close to $2\cdot\pi$, but in this case $\hat\alpha$, $\hat\beta$, and $\hat\gamma$ are close to $0$ which is impossible by the comparison theorem.


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:diam-angle}
Let $p$ and $q$ be points on a closed convex surface $\Sigma$ that lie on maximal intrinsic distance from each other;
that is, $|p\z-q|_\Sigma\ge|x-y|_\Sigma$ for any $x,y\in \Sigma$.
Show that 
\[\measuredangle\hinge xpq\ge \tfrac\pi3\]
for any point $x\in \Sigma\backslash\{p,q\}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:sum=<2pi}
Let $\Sigma$ be a closed (or open) regular surface and with nonnegative Gauss curvature.
Show that 
\[\angk pxy+\angk pyz+\angk pzx\le2\cdot \pi.\]
for any four distinct points $p,x,y,z$ on $\Sigma$.
\end{thm}

\section{Local comparisons}\label{sec:loc-comp}

The following local version of comparison theorem follows from the Rauch comparison (\ref{prop:rauch}).
It will be used in the proof the global version (\ref{thm:comp}).

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:loc-comp}
The comparison theorem (\ref{thm:comp}) holds in a small neighborhood of any point.

Moreover, suppose $\Sigma$ be a smooth regular surface without boundary,
then for any $p\in \Sigma$ there is $r>0$ such that $\inj(x)_\Sigma>r$ if $|p-x|_\Sigma$ and the following statements hold:

\begin{subthm}{thm:loc-comp:cbb}
If $\Sigma$ has nonnegative Gauss curvature, then 
\[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}\ge\angk xyz\]
for any geodesic triangle $[xyz]$ in $B(p,\tfrac r4)_\Sigma$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{thm:loc-comp:cba}
If $\Sigma$ has nonpositive Gauss curvature, then 
\[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}\le\angk xyz\]
for any geodesic triangle $[xyz]$  in $B(p,\tfrac r4)_\Sigma$.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
The existence of $r>0$ follows from \ref{prop:exp}.

Note that $y=\exp_x\vec v$ and $z=\exp_x\vec w$ for two vectors $\vec v,\vec w\in\T_x$ such that 
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle\hinge 0{\vec v}{\vec w}_{\T_x}&=\measuredangle\hinge xyz_\Sigma,
\\
|\vec v|_{\T_x}&=|x-y|_\Sigma, 
\\
|\vec w|_{\T_x}&=|x-z|_\Sigma;
\end{align*}
in particular, $|\vec v|, |\vec w|< \tfrac r2$.
\parit{\ref{SHORT.thm:loc-comp:cbb}.}
Consider the line segment $\tilde \gamma$ joining $\vec v$ to $\vec w$ in the tangent plane $\T_x$ and set $\gamma=\exp_x\circ\tilde \gamma$.
By Rauch comparison (\ref{prop:rauch:K>=0}), we have
\[\length\gamma\le \length \tilde \gamma.\]
Since $|\vec v-\vec w|_{\T_x}=\length\tilde \gamma$ and $|y-z|_{\Sigma}\le \length\gamma$, we get 
\[|\vec v-\vec w|_{\T_x}\ge |y-z|_\Sigma.\]
By angle monotonicity (\ref{lem:angle-monotonicity}), we get
\[\angk xzy\le\measuredangle\hinge 0{\vec v}{\vec w}_{\T_x},\]
whence the result.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.thm:loc-comp:cba}.}
Consider a minimizing geodesic $\gamma$ joining $y$ to $z$ in $\Sigma$.
Since $|x-y|,|x-z|<\tfrac r2$, the triangle inequality implies that $\gamma$ lies in $r$-neighborhood of $x$.
In particular, $\tilde \gamma=\log_x\circ\gamma$ lies in a $r$-neighborhood of zero in $\T_x$ that corresponds to $\gamma$.
Note that $\tilde\gamma$ connects $\vec v$ to $\vec w$ in $\T_x$;

By Rauch comparison (\ref{prop:rauch:K=<0}), we have
\[\length\gamma\ge \length \tilde \gamma.\]
Since $|\vec v-\vec w|_{\T_x}\le\length\tilde \gamma$ and $|y-z|_{\Sigma}= \length\gamma$, we get 
\[|\vec v-\vec w|_{\T_x}\ge |y-z|_\Sigma.\]
By angle monotonicity (\ref{lem:angle-monotonicity}), we get
\[\angk xzy\ge\measuredangle\hinge 0{\vec v}{\vec w}_{\T_x}.\]
whence the result.
\qeds

\parit{Proof of \ref{thm:comp:cat}.}
Sine $\Sigma$ is simply connected, \ref{ex:unique-geod} implies that 
\[\inj(p)_\Sigma=\infty\]
for any $p\in\Sigma$.
Therefore \ref{SHORT.thm:loc-comp:cba} implies \ref{thm:comp:cat}.

\section{Alexandrov's lemma}

It this section we prove the following lemma in the plane geometry.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}
\label{lem:alex}
Assume $[pxyz]$ and $[p'x'y'z']$ be two quadraliterals in the plane with equal corresponding sides.
Assume that the sides $[x'y']$ and $[y'z']$ extend each other; that is, $y'$ lies on the line segment $[x'z']$.
Then the following expressions have the same signs:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
 \item $|p-y|-|p'-y'|$;
 \item $\measuredangle\hinge xpy-\measuredangle\hinge {x'}{p'}{y'}$;
 \item $\pi-\measuredangle\hinge ypx-\measuredangle\hinge ypz$;
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-50}
\vskip-0mm
\end{figure}

\parit{Proof.} 
Take 
a point $\bar z$ on the extension of 
$[xy]$ beyond $y$ so that $\dist{y}{\bar z}{}=\dist{y}{z}{}$ (and therefore $\dist{x}{\bar z}{}=\dist{x'}{z'}{}$). 
 
From angle monotonicity (\ref{lem:angle-monotonicity}), 
the following expressions have the same sign:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $|p-y|-|p'-y'|$;
\item $\measuredangle\hinge{x}{y}{p}-\measuredangle\hinge{x'}{y'}{p'}=\measuredangle\hinge{x}{\bar z}{p}-\measuredangle\hinge{x'}{z'}{p'}$;
\item $|p-\bar z|-|p'-z'|$;
\item $\measuredangle\hinge{y}{\bar z}{p}-\measuredangle\hinge{y'}{z'}{p'}$;
\end{enumerate}
The statement follows since
\[\measuredangle\hinge{y'}{z'}{p'}+\measuredangle\hinge{y'}{x'}{p'}=\pi\]
and
\[\measuredangle\hinge{y}{\bar z}{p}+\measuredangle\hinge{y}{x}{p}=\pi.\]
\qedsf

\section{Reformulations}

In this section we formulate conditions equivalent to the conclusion of the comparison theorem (\ref{thm:comp}).

A triangle $[xyz]$ in a surface is called \index{fat triangle}\emph{fat} (or, respectively, \index{thin triangle}\emph{thin})
if for any two points $p$ and $q$ on the sides of the triangle and the corresponding points 
$\tilde p$ and $\tilde q$ on the sides of its model triangle $[\tilde x\tilde y\tilde z]\z=\tilde\triangle xyz$ we have
$|p-q|\ge |\tilde p-\tilde q|$ (or respectively $|p-q|\le |\tilde p-\tilde q|$).


\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:comp-reformulations}
Let $\Sigma$ be a proper smooth regular surface.
Then the following three conditions are equivalent:

\begin{subthm}{mang>angk}
For any geodesic triangle $[xyz]$ in $\Sigma$ we have
 \[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}\ge\angk xyz.\]
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{angk>angk} For any geodesic triangle $[pxz]$ in $\Sigma$ and $y$ on the side $[xz]$ we have
 \[\angk xpy \ge \angk xpz.\]
 
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{fat}
 Any geodesic triangle in $\Sigma$ is fat.
\end{subthm}


\medskip

Similarly, following three conditions are equivalent:

\begin{subthmA}{mang<angk}
For any geodesic triangle $[xyz]$ in $\Sigma$ we have
 \[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}\le\angk xyz.\]
\end{subthmA}

\begin{subthmA}{angk<angk} For any geodesic triangle $[pxz]$ in $\Sigma$ and $y$ on the side $[xz]$ we have
 \[\angk xpy \le \angk xpz.\]
\end{subthmA}

\begin{subthmA}{thin}
Any geodesic triangle in $\Sigma$ is thin.
\end{subthmA}

\end{thm}

In the proof we will use the following translation of Alexandrov lemma to the language of comparison triangles and angles.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{25mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-2305}
\end{wrapfigure}

\begin{thm}{Reformulation of Alexandrov lemma}\label{lem:alex-reformulation}\\
Assume $[pxz]$ be a triangle in a surface $\Sigma$ and 
the point $y$ lies on the side $[xz]$.
Consider its model triangle $[\tilde p\tilde x\tilde z]=\tilde\triangle pxz$ and let $\tilde y$ be the corresponding point on the side $[\tilde x\tilde z]$.
Then the following expressions have the same signs:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
 \item $|p-y|_\Sigma-|\tilde p-\tilde y|_{\RR^2}$;
 \item $\angk xpy-\angk {x}{p}{z}$;
 \item $\pi-\angk ypx-\angk ypz$;
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} We will prove the implications \ref{SHORT.mang>angk}$\Rightarrow$\ref{SHORT.angk>angk}$\Rightarrow$\ref{SHORT.fat}$\Rightarrow$\ref{SHORT.mang>angk}.
The implications \ref{SHORT.mang<angk}$\Rightarrow$\ref{SHORT.angk<angk}$\Rightarrow$\ref{SHORT.thin}$\Rightarrow$\ref{SHORT.mang<angk} can be done the same way.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.mang>angk}$\Rightarrow$\ref{SHORT.angk>angk}.}
Note that $\measuredangle\hinge ypx+\measuredangle\hinge ypz=\pi$.
By \textit{\ref{SHORT.mang>angk}}, 
\[\angk ypx+\angk ypz\le \pi.\]
It reamains to apply Alexandrov's lemma (\ref{lem:alex-reformulation}).


\parit{\ref{SHORT.angk>angk}$\Rightarrow$\ref{SHORT.fat}.}
Applying \textit{\ref{SHORT.mang>angk}} twice, first for $y\in [xz]$ and then for $w\in [px]$, we get that
\[\angk xwy \ge \angk xpy \ge \angk xpz\]
and therefore
\[|w-y|_\Sigma\ge |\tilde w-\tilde y|_{\RR^2},\]
where $\tilde w$ and $\tilde y$ are the points corresponding to $w$ and $y$ points on the sides of the model triangle. Hence the implication follows.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.fat}$\Rightarrow$\ref{SHORT.mang>angk}.}
Since the triangle is fat, we have 
\[\angk xwy \ge \angk xpz\]
for any $w\in \left]xp\right]$ and $y\in \left]xz\right]$.
Note that $\angk xwy\to \measuredangle\hinge xpz$ as $w,y\to x$, whence the implication follows.
\qeds

In the following exercises you can apply the globalization theorem.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:geod-convexity}
Let $\Sigma$ be an open smooth regular surface
and $\gamma$ be a unit-speed geodesic in $\Sigma$ and $p\in\Sigma$.

Consider the function
\[h(t)=|p-\gamma(t)|_\Sigma^2-t^2.\]

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that if the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is nonnegative, then the function $h$ is concave.
\item Show that if $\Sigma$ is simply connected and the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is nonpositive, then the function $h$ is convex.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:midpoints}
Let $\bar x$ and $\bar y$ be the midpoints of minimizing geodesics $[px]$ and $[py]$ in an open smooth regular surface $\Sigma$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
 \item Show that if the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is nonnegative, then 
 \[2\cdot |\bar x-\bar y|_\Sigma\ge |x-y|_\Sigma.\]
 \item Show that if $\Sigma$ is simply connected and has nonpositive Gauss curvature, then 
 \[2\cdot |\bar x-\bar y|_\Sigma\le |x-y|_\Sigma.\]
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}


\section{Nonnegative curvature}\label{sec:nonneg-comp}

We will prove \ref{thm:comp:toponogov}, first assuming that $\Sigma$ is compact.
The general case requires only minor modifications; they are indicated in Exercise \ref{ex:open-comparison} at the end of the section.
The proof is taken from \cite{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin2027} and it is very close to the proof given by Urs Lang and Viktor Schroeder \cite{lang-schroeder}.

\parit{Proof of \ref{thm:comp:toponogov} in the compact case.}\label{proof(thm:comp:toponogov)}
Assume $\Sigma$ is compact. 
From the local theorem (\ref{thm:loc-comp}), we get that there is $\eps>0$ such that the inequality 
\[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{p}{q}\ge\angk xpq.\]
holds for any hinge $\hinge {x}{p}{q}$ such that $|x-p|+|x-q|<\eps$.
The following lemma states that in this case the same holds for any hinge $\hinge {x}{p}{q}$ such that $|x-p|+|x-q|<\tfrac32\cdot\eps$.
Applying the key lemma (\ref{key-lem:globalization}) few times we will get that the comparison holds for arbitrary hinge, which will prove \mbox{\ref{thm:comp:toponogov}}.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Key lemma}\label{key-lem:globalization}  
Let $\Sigma$ be an open smooth regular surface.
Assume that the comparison
\[\measuredangle\hinge x y z
\ge\angk x y z\eqlbl{eq:key-lem:globalization}\]
holds for any hinge $\hinge x y z$ with 
$\dist{x}{y}{}+\dist{x}{z}{}
<
\frac{2}{3}\cdot\ell$.
Then the comparison \ref{eq:key-lem:globalization}
holds for any hinge $\hinge x y z$ with $\dist{x}{y}{}+\dist{x}{z}{}<\ell$.
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{35mm}
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-2308}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.} 
Given a hinge $\hinge x p q$ consider a triangle in the plane
with angle $\measuredangle\hinge x p q$ and two adjacent sides $|x-p|$ and $|x-q|$.
Let us denote by $\side \hinge x p q$ the third side of this triangle; let us call it \index{model side}\emph{model side} of the hinge.

Note that the inequalities 
\[\measuredangle\hinge x p q\ge \angk x p q\quad\text{and}\quad\side \hinge x p q
\ge\dist{p}{q}{}\]
are equivalent.
So it is sufficient to prove that
\[\side \hinge x p q
\ge\dist{p}{q}{}.\eqlbl{eq:thm:=def-loc*}\] 
for any hinge $\hinge x p q$ with $\dist{x}{p}{}+\dist{x}{q}{}<\ell$.

Let us describe a construction that produce a new hinge $\hinge{x'}p q$ for a
a given hinge $\hinge x p q$ such that 
\[\tfrac{2}{3}\cdot\ell \le\dist{p}{x}{}\z+\dist{x}{q}{}< \ell.\]
The new hinge $\hinge{x'}p q$ will satisfy the following properties:
\[\side \hinge x p q
\ge\side \hinge{x'}p q
\eqlbl{eq:thm:=def-loc-fivestar}\]
and 
$x'\in [xp]\z\cup [xq]$; in particular
\[
\dist{p}{x}{}+\dist{x}{q}{}\ge\dist{p}{x'}{}+\dist{x'}{q}{}.
\eqlbl{eq:thm:=def-loc-fourstar}\]

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{35mm}
\vskip -4mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-2310}
\end{wrapfigure}

%\parit{Construction of $\hinge{x'}p q$.}
Assume $\dist{x}{q}{}\ge\dist{x}{p}{}$, otherwise switch the roles of $p$ and $q$ in the following construction.
Take $x'\in [x q]$ such that 
\[\dist{p}{x}{}+3\cdot\dist{x}{x'}{}
=\tfrac{2}{3}\cdot\ell \eqlbl{3|xx'|}\]
Choose a geodesic $[x' p]$ and consider the  hinge $\hinge{x'}p q$ fromed by $[x'p]$ and $[x' q]\subset [x q]$. 
Then \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc-fourstar} follows since
\[|x'-p|_\Sigma\le |x'-x|_\Sigma+|x'-p|_\Sigma.\]

By \ref{3|xx'|}, we have that 
\begin{align*}
\dist{p}{x}{\Sigma}\z+\dist{x}{x'}{\Sigma}&<\tfrac{2}{3}\cdot\ell,
\\
\dist{p}{x'}{\Sigma}\z+\dist{x'}{x}{\Sigma}&<\tfrac{2}{3}\cdot\ell.
\end{align*}
In particular, 
\[\measuredangle\hinge x p{x'}
\ge\angk x p{x'}
\ \ \text{and}\ \ 
\measuredangle\hinge {x'}p x
\ge\angk {x'}p x.
\eqlbl{eq:thm:=def-loc-threestar}\]


Consider the model triangle
$\trig{\tilde x}{\tilde x'}{\tilde p}=\modtrig xx'p$.
Take $\tilde  q$ on the extension of $[\tilde  x\tilde  x']$ beyond $x'$ such that $\dist{\tilde x}{\tilde q}{}=\dist{x}{q}{}$ (and therefore $\dist{\tilde x'}{\tilde q}{}=\dist{x'}{q}{}$).
From \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc-threestar},
\[\measuredangle\hinge x p q
=\measuredangle\hinge  x p{x'}\ge\angk x p{x'}\ \ \Rightarrow\ \ 
\side \hinge x q p\ge\dist{\tilde p}{\tilde q}{}.\]
Since $\measuredangle\hinge{x'}p x+\measuredangle\hinge{x'}p q= \pi$,
\ref{eq:thm:=def-loc-threestar} implies
\[
\pi
-\angk{x'}p x
\ge
\pi-\measuredangle\hinge{x'}p x
\ge
\measuredangle\hinge{x'}p q.
\]
Therefore
$\dist{\tilde p}{\tilde q}{}\ge\side \hinge{x'}q p$ and \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc-fivestar} follows.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics{mppics/pic-2315}
\end{figure}

Set $x_0=x$.
Let us apply inductively the above construction to get a sequence of hinges  $\hinge{x_n}p q$ with $x_{n+1}=x_n'$.
By \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc-fivestar} and triangle inequality, both sequences
\[s_n=\side \hinge{x_n}pq\quad\text{and}\quad r_n=\dist{p}{x_n}{}+\dist{x_n}{q}{}\]
are nonincreasing.

The sequence might terminate at some $n$ only if $r_n< \tfrac{2}{3}\cdot\ell $.
In this case, by the assumptions of the lemma, 
\[s_n=\side \hinge{x_n}p q\ge\dist{p}{q}{}.\]
Since sequence $s_n$ is nonincreasing;
\[s_0=\side \hinge{x}p q\ge\dist{p}{q}{},\]
whence inequality \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc*} follows.

If the sequence does not terminate, then $r_n\ge\tfrac{2}{3}\cdot\ell$ for all $n$.
Since $(r_n)$ is nonincreasing, $r_n\to r\ge |p-q|_\Sigma$ as $n\to\infty$.

Let us show that $\measuredangle\hinge{x_n}p q\to \pi$ as $n\to\infty$.

Indeed assume $\measuredangle\hinge{x_n}p q\le \pi-\eps$ for some $\eps>0$.
Without loss of generality we can assume that $x_{n+1}\in [x_nq]$;
otherwise switch $p$ and $q$ further.
Note that $|x_n-x_{n+1}|,|p-x_n|>\tfrac\ell{100}$.
Therefore by comparison 
\[|p-x_{n+1}|<\side\hinge{x_n}p{x_{n+1}}<|p-x_n|+|x_n-x_{n+1}|-\delta\]
for some fixed $\delta=\delta(\eps)>0$.
Therefore $r_n-r_{n+1}>\delta$.
The latter can not hold for large $n$, otherwise the sequence $r_n$ would not converge.

It follows that for any $\eps>0$ we have that $\measuredangle\hinge{x_n}p q> \pi-\eps$ for all large $n$;
that is, $\measuredangle\hinge{x_n}p q\to \pi$ as $n\to\infty$.

Since $\measuredangle\hinge{x_n}p q\to \pi$, we have 
$s_n-r_n\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$;
that is, $s_n\to r$.

Since the sequence $(s_n)$ is nonincreasing and $r\ge |p-q|$, we get
\[s_n\ge |p-q|\]
for any $n$.
In particular
\[\side\hinge spq=s_0\ge |p-q|,\] so we obtain \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc*}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:open-comparison}

Given $p\in\Sigma$, denote by $R_p$

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{ex:convex-polyhon+self-intersections}
Let $\Sigma$ be a closed smooth regular surface with nonnegative Gauss curvature.
The following sketch that shows that a closed geodesic $\gamma$ on $\Sigma$ cannot have self-intersections as shown on the diagram;
in other words, $\gamma$ cannot cut $\Sigma$ into 3 monogons, one quadrangle, and one pentagon. 

Make a complete proof from it.

Arguing by contradiction, suppose that such geodesic exists;
assume that arcs and angles are labeled as on the left diagram.

\begin{subthm}{ex:convex-polyhon+self-intersections:angles}
Apply Gauss--Bonnet formula to show that
\[2\cdot\alpha<\beta+\gamma\]
and 
\[2\cdot\beta+2\cdot \gamma<\pi+\alpha.\]
Conclude that $\alpha <\tfrac \pi 3$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{ex:convex-polyhon}
Consider the part of the geodesic $\gamma$ without the arc~$a$.
It cuts from $\Sigma$ a pentagon with sides and angles as shown on the diagram. 
Show that there is a plane pentagon with convex sides of the same length and angles at most as big.

Arrive to a contradiction using \ref{SHORT.ex:convex-polyhon+self-intersections:angles} and \ref{SHORT.ex:convex-polyhon}.

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{ex:dist-to-bry}
Suppose that a closed geodesic $\delta$ bounds a disc $\Delta$ in a closed convex surface $\Sigma$.
Given a point $p\in\Delta$, denote by $f(p)$ the intrinsic distance from $p$ to $\delta$;
that is,
\[f(p)=\inf\set{|p-x|_\Sigma}{x\in\delta}.\]
Show that the function $f$ is concave;
that is, for any geodesic $\gamma$ in $\Delta$ the function $t\mapsto f\circ\gamma(t)$ is concave.
