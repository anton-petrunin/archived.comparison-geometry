\section{Formulation}

A minimizing geodesic between points $x$ and $y$ in a surface $\Sigma$ will be denoted as $[xy]$ or $[xy]_\Sigma$;
the latter notation is used if we need to emphasise that the geodesic lies in $\Sigma$.
If we write $[xy]$, then we assume that a minimizing geodesic exists and we made a choice of one of them.
If $\Sigma$ is complete, then a minimizing geodesic always exists. %%%???should we prove it???

A \emph{geodesic triangle} in a surface $\Sigma$ is a triple of points $x,y,z\in \Sigma$ with choice of minimizing geodesics $[xy]$, $[yz]$ and $[zx]$.
The points $x,y,z$ are called \emph{vertexes} of the geodesic triangle,
the minimizing geodesics $[xy]$, $[yz]$ and $[zx]$ are called its sides;
the triangle itself is denoted by $[xyz]$.
(The notation $[xyz]$ is just a shortcut for the array $(x,y,z,[xy], [yz], [zx])$.)

The length of one (and therefore any) minimizing geodesic $[xy]_\Sigma$ will be denoted by $|x-y|_\Sigma$; it is called \emph{intrinsic distance} from $x$ to $y$ in $\Sigma$.
If defined, then $|x-y|_\Sigma$ is the exact lower bound on the lengths of curves from $x$ to $y$ in $\Sigma$. 

A triangle $[\~x\~y\~z]$ in the plane is called \emph{model triangle} of the triangle $[xyz]$,
briefly $[\~x\~y\~z]=\~\triangle xyz$, if its corresponding sides are equal;
that is,
\[|\~x-\~y|=|x-y|_\Sigma,
\quad
|\~y-\~z|=|y-z|_\Sigma,
\quad
|\~z-\~x|=|z-x|_\Sigma.
\]

A pair of minimizing geodesics $[xy]$ and $[xz]$ starting from one point $x$ is called \emph{hinge} and denoted as $\hinge xyz$.
The angle between these geodesics at $x$ is denoted by $\measuredangle\hinge xyz$.
The corresponding angle $\measuredangle\hinge {\~x}{\~y}{\~z}$ in the model triangle $[\~x\~y\~z]=\~\triangle xyz$ is denoted by $\angk xyz$.

A surface $\Sigma$ is called \emph{simply connected} if any closed simple curve in $\Sigma$ bounds a disc.
Equivalently any closed curve in $\Sigma$ can be continuously deformed into a trivial curve (trivial means that it stays at one point).
A plane or sphere are examples of simply connected surfaces, while torus or cylinder are not simply connected.


\begin{thm}{Comparison theorem}\label{thm:comp}
Let $\Sigma$ be a complete smooth regular surface with a geodesic triangle $[xyz]$.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
 \item\label{thm:comp:toponogov} If $\Sigma$ has nonnegative Gauss curvature, then 
 \[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}\ge\angk xyz.\]
 \item\label{thm:comp:cat} If $\Sigma$ is simply connected and has nonpositive Gauss curvature,
 then 
 \[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}\le\angk xyz.\]
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}


Let us make few remarks on the formulation.

The angle $\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}$ is a number in the interval $[0,\pi]$.
If the triangle $[xyz]$ bounds a disc $\Delta$ and $\theta$ is the external angle at  $x$ which used in Gauss--Bonnet formula, 
then $\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}=|\pi-\theta|$.
The corresponding internal angle might be $\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}$ or $2\cdot\pi-\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}$ depending on which side lies the disc $\Delta$.

Since the angles of any plane triangle sum up to $\pi$,
the part (\ref{thm:comp:toponogov}) of the theorem implies that angles of any triangle in a surface with nonnegative Gauss curvature have sum at least $\pi$.
If the triangle bounds a disc, then by Gauss--Bonnet formula the sum of its internal angles is at least $\pi$.
Note that the triangle may not bound a disc, for example equator on the cyclinder is formed by a geodesic triangle that does not bound a disc.
Also note that (1) Gauss--Bonnet formula gives a lower bound on the sum of its \emph{internal} angles, but does not bound each angle separately (2) if $\alpha$ is the angle in the comparison theorem, then the internal angle might be $\alpha$ or $2\cdot\pi-\alpha$; while Gauss--Bonnet formula gives a lower bound on the sum of internal angles it does not forbid that each of these angles is close to $2\cdot \pi$ which is impossible by the comparison theorem.

On the part (\ref{thm:comp:cat}).
First note that without condition that $\Sigma$ is simply connected, the statement does not hold.
For example the equator $z=0$ of infinite cylinder (which is not simply connected)
\[\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{x^2+y^2=1}\]
is formed by a triangle with all angles $\pi$; which contradict the comparison.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $\Sigma$ be a complete smooth regular simply connected surface with nonpositive Gauss curvature.
Show that any two points in $\Sigma$ are connected by unique geodesic.
\end{thm}


\section{Names and history}

Part (\ref{thm:comp:toponogov}) of this theorem is called \emph{Toponogov comparison theorem};
it is was proved by Paolo Pizzetti \cite{pizzetti} and latter independently by Alexandr Alexandrov \cite{alexandrov}; generalizations were obtained by  Victor Toponogov \cite{toponogov}, Mikhael Gromov, Yuri Burago and Grigory Perelman \cite{BGP}.

Part (\ref{thm:comp:cat}) is called \emph{Cartan--Hadamard theorem};
it was proved by 
Hans von Mangoldt \cite{mangoldt} and generalized by Elie Cartan \cite{cartan}, Jacques Hadamard \cite{hadamard},
Herbert Busemann \cite{busemann},
Willi Rinow in \cite{rinow},
Mikhael Gromov \cite[p.119]{gromov},
Stephanie Alexander and Richard Bishop in \cite{a-b:h-c}.

\section{Local part}

First we prove the following local version of comparison theorem and then use it to prove the global version.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
The comparison theorem (\ref{thm:comp}) holds in a small neighborhood of any point.

That is, if $\Sigma$ be a complete smooth regular surface,
then any point $p\in \Sigma$ admits a neighborhood $U$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
 \item If $\Sigma$ has nonnegative Gauss curvature, then for any geodesic triangle $[xyz]$ in $U$ we have
 \[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}\ge\angk xyz.\]
 \item If $\Sigma$ has nonpositive Gauss curvature, then for any geodesic triangle $[xyz]$ in $U$ we have
 \[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}\le\angk xyz.\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume $y=\exp_xv$ and $z=\exp_xw$ for two small vectors $v,w\in\T_x$.
Note that 
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle \hinge xvw_{\T_x}&=\measuredangle \hinge xyz_\Sigma,
\\
|x-y|_\Sigma&=|x-v|_{\T_x}, 
\\
|x-z|_\Sigma&=|x-w|_{\T_x}.
\end{align*}


If the Gauss curvature is nonnegative,
consider the line segment $\~\gamma$ joining $v$ to $w$ in the tangent plane $\T_x$ and set $\gamma=\exp_x\circ\~\gamma$.
By Rauch comparison theorem (\ref{thm:rauch}), we have
\[\length\gamma\le \length \~\gamma.\]
Since $|v-w|_{\T_x}=\length\~\gamma$ and $|y-z|_{\Sigma}\le \length\gamma$, we get 
\[|v-w|_{\T_x}\ge |y-z|_\Sigma.\]
Therefore
\[\angk xzy\ge \measuredangle\hinge xzy.\]

If the Gauss curvature is nonpositive,
consider a minimizing geodesic $\gamma$ joining $y$ to $z$ in $\Sigma$ and let $\~\gamma$ be the corresponding curve joining $v$ to $w$ in $\T_x$; that is,  $\gamma=\exp_x\circ\~\gamma$.
By Rauch comparison theorem (\ref{thm:rauch}), we have
\[\length\gamma\ge \length \~\gamma.\]
Since $|v-w|_{\T_x}\le\length\~\gamma$ and $|y-z|_{\Sigma}= \length\gamma$, we get 
\[|v-w|_{\T_x}\ge |y-z|_\Sigma.\]
Therefore
\[\angk xzy\ge \measuredangle\hinge xzy.\]

\section{Alexandrov's lemma}

It this section we prove the following lemma in the plane geometry.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}
\label{lem:alex}
Assume $[pxyz]$ and $[p'x'y'z']$ be two quadraliterals in the plane with equal corresponding sides.
Assume that the sides $[x'y']$ and $[y'z']$ extend each other; that is, $y'$ lies on the line segment $[x'z']$.
Then the following expressions have the same signs:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
 \item $|p-y|-|p'-y'|$;
 \item $\measuredangle\hinge xpy-\measuredangle\hinge {x'}{p'}{y'}$;
 \item $\pi-\measuredangle\hinge ypx-\measuredangle\hinge ypz$;
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} 
In the proof we use the following \emph{monotonicity property}:
if two sides adjacent to an angle in a plane triangle are fixed, 
then the angle is increases if the opposite side increase.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-50}
\vskip-0mm
\end{figure}

Take 
a point $\bar z$ on the extension of 
$[xy]$ beyond $y$ so that $\dist{y}{\bar z}{}=\dist{y}{z}{}$ (and therefore $\dist{x}{\bar z}{}=\dist{x'}{z'}{}$). 
 
From monotonicity, 
the following expressions have the same sign:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $|p-y|-|p'-y'|$;
\item $\measuredangle\hinge{x}{y}{p}-\measuredangle\hinge{x'}{y'}{p'}=\measuredangle\hinge{x}{\bar z}{p}-\measuredangle\hinge{x'}{z'}{p'}$;
\item $|p-\bar z|-|p'-z'|$;
\item $\measuredangle\hinge{y}{\bar z}{p}-\measuredangle\hinge{y'}{z'}{p'}$;
\end{enumerate}
The statement follows since
\[\measuredangle\hinge{y'}{z'}{p'}+\measuredangle\hinge{y'}{x'}{p'}=\pi\]
and
\[\measuredangle\hinge{y}{\bar z}{p}+\measuredangle\hinge{y}{x}{p}=\pi.\]
\qedsf

Further we will use the following reformulation of this lemma that is using language of comparison triangles.

\begin{thm}{Reformulation}\label{lem:alex-reformulation}
\label{lem:alex}
Assume $[pxz]$ be a triangle in a surface $\Sigma$ and 
the point $y$ lies on the side $[xz]$.
Consider its model triangle $[\~p\~x\~z]=\~\triangle pxz$ and let $\~y$ be the corresponding point on the side $[\~x\~z]$.
Then the following expressions have the same signs:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
 \item $|p-y|_\Sigma-|\~p-\~y|_{\RR^2}$;
 \item $\angk xpy-\angk {x}{p}{z}$;
 \item $\pi-\angk ypx-\angk ypz$;
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\section{Reformulations of comparison}

In this section we formulate conditions equivalent to the conclusion of the comparison theorem
(which is not yet proved).

A triangle $[xyz]$ in a surface is called \emph{fat} (or correspondingly \emph{thin})
if for any two points $p$ and $q$ on the sides of the triangle and the corresponding points 
$\~p$ and $\~q$ on the sides of its model triangle $[\~x\~y\~z]\z=\~\triangle xyz$ we have
$|p-q|\ge |\~p-\~q|$ (or correspondingly $|p-q|\le |\~p-\~q|$).

Let us reformulate the comparison theorem (\ref{thm:comp}) using thin and fat triangles:

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Let $\Sigma$ be a complete smooth regular surface.
Then the following three conditions are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[(i$^{+}$)]
\item For any geodesic triangle $[xyz]$ in $\Sigma$ we have
 \[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}\ge\angk xyz.\]
\item For any geodesic triangle $[pxz]$ in $\Sigma$ and $y$ on the side $[xz]$ we have
 \[\angk xpy \ge \angk xpz.\]
\item Any geodesic triangle in $\Sigma$ is fat.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip

Similarly, following three conditions are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[(i$^{-}$)]
\item For any geodesic triangle $[xyz]$ in $\Sigma$ we have
 \[\measuredangle\hinge {x}{y}{z}\le\angk xyz.\]
\item For any geodesic triangle $[pxz]$ in $\Sigma$ and $y$ on the side $[xz]$ we have
 \[\angk xpy \le \angk xpz.\]
\item Any geodesic triangle in $\Sigma$ is thin.
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof; (i$^{+}$)$\Longrightarrow$(ii$^{+}$).}
Note that $\measuredangle\hinge ypx+\measuredangle\hinge ypz=\pi$.
By \textit{(i$^{+}$)}, 
\[\angk ypx+\angk ypz\le \pi.\]
It reamains to apply Alexandrov's lemma \ref{lem:alex-reformulation}.

The implication \textit{(i$^{-}$)$\Longrightarrow$(ii$^{-}$)} can be done the same way.

\parit{(ii$^{+}$)$\Longrightarrow$(iii$^{+}$).}
Applying \textit{(i$^{+}$)} twice, first for $y\in [xz]$ and then for $w\in [px]$, we get that
\[\angk xwy \ge \angk xpy \ge \angk xpz\]
and therefore
\[|w-y|_\Sigma\ge |\~w-\~y|_{\RR^2},\]
where $\~w$ and $\~y$ are the points corresponding to $w$ and $y$ points on the sides of the model triangle. Hence the implication follows.

The implication \textit{(ii$^{-}$)$\Longrightarrow$(iii$^{-}$)} can be done the same way.

\parit{(iii$^{+}$)$\Longrightarrow$(i$^{+}$).}
Since the triangle is fat, we have 
\[\angk xwy \ge \angk xpz\]
for any $w\in \left]xp\right]$ and $y\in \left]xz\right]$.
Note that $\angk xwy\to \measuredangle\hinge xpz$ as $w,y\to x$; hence the implication follows.

The implication \textit{(iii$^{-}$)$\Longrightarrow$(i$^{-}$)} can be done the same way.
