\section{Topological surfaces}

We will be mostly interested in smooth regular surfaces defined in the following section.
However few times we will use the following general definition.

A connected subset $\Sigma$ in the Euclidean space $\RR^3$
is called a \index{topological surface}\emph{topological surface} (more precisely an {}\emph{embedded surface without boundary}) 
if any point of $p\in \Sigma$ admits a neighborhood $W$ in $\Sigma$ 
that can be parameterized by an open subset in the Euclidean plane; %???parameterized
that is, there is an injective continuous map $U\to W$ from an open set $U\subset \RR^2$ such that its inverse $W\to U$ is also continuous.


\section{Smooth surfaces}

Recall that a function $f$ of two variables $x$ and $y$ is called \index{smooth function}\emph{smooth} if all its partial derivatives $\frac{\partial^{m+n}}{\partial x^m\partial y^n}f$ are defined and are continuous in the domain of definition of $f$. 

A connected set $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is called a \index{smooth surface}\emph{smooth surface} (or more precisely {}\emph{smooth regular embedded surface}) if it can be described locally as a graph of a smooth function in an appropriate coordinate system.\label{page:def-smooth-surface} %???+regular???spoken term

More precisely, for any point $p\in \Sigma$ one can choose a coordinate system $(x,y,z)$ and a neighborhood $U\ni p$ such that
the intersection $W=U\cap \Sigma$ is formed by a graph $z=f(x,y)$ of a smooth function $f$ defined in an open domain of the $(x,y)$-plane.

\parbf{Examples.}
The simplest example of a smooth surface is the $(x,y)$-plane 
\[\Pi=\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{z=0}.\]
The plane $\Pi$ is a surface since
it can be described as the graph of the function $f(x,y)=0$.

All other planes are smooth surfaces as well since one can choose a coordinate system so that it becomes the $(x,y)$-plane.
We may also present a plane as a graph of a linear function 
$f(x,y)=a\cdot x+b\cdot y+c$ for some constants $a$, $b$ and $c$
(assuming the plane is not perpendicular to the $(x,y)$-plane).

A more interesting example is the unit sphere 
\[\mathbb{S}^2=\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{x^2+y^2+z^2=1}.\]
This set is not the graph of any function,
but $\mathbb{S}^2$ is locally a graph;
it can be covered by the following 6 graphs:
\begin{align*}
z&=f_\pm(x,y)=\pm \sqrt{1-x^2-y^2},
\\
y&=g_\pm(x,z)=\pm \sqrt{1-x^2-z^2},
\\
x&=h_\pm(y,z)=\pm \sqrt{1-y^2-z^2},
\end{align*}
where each function $f_\pm,g_\pm,h_\pm$ is defined in an open unit disc.
Any point $p\in\mathbb{S}^2$ lies in one of these graphs therefore $\mathbb{S}^2$ is a surface.
Since each function is smooth, so is $\mathbb{S}^2$.

\section{Surfaces with boundary}
A connected subset in a surface that is bounded by one or more 
curves is called \index{surface with boundary}\emph{surface with boundary}; the curves form the \index{boundary line}\emph{boundary line} of the surface.

When we say {}\emph{surface} we usually mean a {}\emph{smooth regular surface without boundary};
we may use the terms {}\emph{surface without boundary} if we need to emphasize it;
otherwise we may use the term {}\emph{surface with possibly nonempty boundary}.

\section{Proper, closed and open surfaces}
If the surface $\Sigma$ is formed by a closed set, then it is called \index{proper surface}\emph{proper}.
For example, for any smooth function $f$, defined on whole plane, its graph $z=f(x,y)$ is a proper surface.
The sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ gives another example of proper surface.

On the other hand, the open disc 
\[\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{x^2+y^2<1,\  z=0}\]
is not proper; this set is neither open nor closed.

A compact surface without boundary is called \index{closed surface}\emph{closed}
(this term is closely related to {}\emph{closed curve} but has nothing to do with {}\emph{closed set}).

A proper noncompact surface without boundary is called \index{open surfac}\emph{open} (again the term {}\emph{open set} is not relevant).

For example, the paraboloid $z=x^2+y^2$
is an open surface; 
sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ is a closed surface.

Note that any proper surface without boundary is either closed or open.

The following claim is a two-dimesional analog of \ref{ex:proper-curve};
hopefully it is intuitively obvious. 
Its proof is not at all trivial; a standard proof uses the so-called \index{Alexander's duality}\emph{Alexander's duality} which is a classical technique in algebraic topology. %???+ref
We omit its proof since it would take us far away from the main subject.

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:proper-divides}
The complement of any proper topological surface without boundary (or, equivalently any open or closed topological surface) has exactly two connected components. 
\end{thm}

\section{Implicitly defined surfaces}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:implicit-surface}
Let $f\:\RR^3\to \RR$ be a smooth function.
Suppose that $0$ is a regular value of $f$;
that is, $\nabla_p f\ne 0$ if $f(p)=0$.
Then any connected component $\Sigma$ of the set of solutions of the equation $f(x,y,z)=0$ is a surface.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Fix $p\in\Sigma$.
Since $\nabla_p f\ne 0$ we have 
\[f_x(p)\ne 0,\quad f_y(p)\ne 0,\quad \text{or}\quad f_z(p)\ne 0.\]
We may assume thate $f_z(p)\ne 0$;
otherwise permute the coordinates $x,y,z$.

The implicit function theorem (\ref{thm:imlicit}) implies that a neighborhood of $p$ in $\Sigma$ is the graph $z=h(x,y)$ of a smooth function $h$ defined on an open domain in $\RR^2$.
It remains to apply the definition of smooth surface (page \pageref{page:def-smooth-surface}).

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:hyperboloinds}
Describe the set of real numbers $\ell$
such that the equation
\begin{align*}
x^2+y^2-z^2&=\ell
\end{align*}
describes a smooth regular surface.
\end{thm}

\section{Local parametrizations}

Let $U$ be an open domain in $\RR^2$ and $s\:U\to \RR^3$ be a smooth map.
We say that $s$ is regular if its Jacobian has maximal rank;
in this case it means that the vectors $s_u$ and $s_v$ are linearly independent at any $(u,v)\in U$;
equivalently $s_u\times s_v\ne 0$, where $\times$ denotes the vector product.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:graph-chart}
If $s\:U\to \RR^3$ is a smooth regular embedding %???embedding???
of an open connected set $U\subset \RR^2$, then its image $\Sigma=s(U)$ is a smooth surface.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Set 
\[s(u,v)=(x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v)).\]
Since $s$ is regular, its Jacobian matrix
\[\Jac s=
\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.3}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_u&x_v\\
y_u&y_v\\
z_u&z_v
\end{pmatrix}
\]
has rank two at any pint $(u,v)\in U$.

Fix a point $p\in \Sigma$; by shifting the coordinate system we may assume that $p$ is the origin.
Permuting the coordinates $x,y,z$ if necessary, we may assume that 
the matrix 
\[
\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.3}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_u&x_v\\
y_u&y_v
\end{pmatrix},
\] 
is invertible.
Note that this is the Jacobian matix of the map
\[(u,v)\mapsto (x(u,v),y(u,v)).\]

The inverse function theorem implies that there is a smooth regular function $h$ defined on an open set $W\ni 0$ in the $(x,y)$-plane
such that 
\[(x\circ h)(x,y)=x\quad\text{and}\quad (y\circ h)(x,y)=y\]
for any $(x,y)\in W$.
It follows that the graph $z=z\circ h(x,y)$ for $(x,y)\in W$ is a subset in $\Sigma$.
Clearly this graph is open in $\Sigma$. %???why
Since $p$ is arbitrary, we get that $\Sigma$ is a surface.
\qeds

If we have $s$ and $\Sigma$ as in the proposition, then we say that $s$ is a \index{smooth parametrization}\emph{smooth parametrization} of the surface $\Sigma$. 

Not all the smooth surfaces can be described by such a parametrization;
for example the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ cannot.
But any smooth surface $\Sigma$ admits a local parametrization; that is, any point $p\in\Sigma$ admits an open neighborhood $W\subset \Sigma$ with a smooth regular parametrization~$s$.
In this case any point in $W$ can be described by two parameters, usually denoted by $u$ and $v$, 
which are called \index{local coordinates}\emph{local coordinates} at $p$.
The map $s$ is called a \index{chart}\emph{chart} of $\Sigma$.

If $W$ is a graph $z=h(x,y)$ of a smooth function $h$, then the map 
\[s\:(u,v)\mapsto (u,v,h(u,v))\] is a chart.
Indeed, $s$ has an inverse $(u,v,h(u,v))\mapsto (u,v)$ which is continuous;
that is, $s$ is an embedding.
Further,
$s_u=(1,0,h_u)$ and $s_v=(0,1,h_v)$. 
Whence the partial derivatives $s_u$ and $s_v$ are linearly independent;
that is, $s$ is a regular map.

Note that from \ref{prop:graph-chart}, we obtain the following corollary.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:reg-parmeterization}
A connected set $\Sigma\subset \RR^3$ is a smooth regular surface if and only if $\Sigma$ has a local parametrization by a smooth regular map at any point $p\in\Sigma$.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:inversion-chart}
Consider the following map 
\[s(u,v)=(\tfrac{2\cdot u}{1+u^2+v^2},\tfrac{2\cdot v}{1+u^2+v^2},\tfrac{2}{1+u^2+v^2}).\]
Show that $s$ is a chart of the unit sphere centered at $(0,0,1)$; describe the image of $s$.
\end{thm}

The map $s$ in the exercise can be visualized using the following map
\[(u,v,1)\mapsto (\tfrac{2\cdot u}{1+u^2+v^2},\tfrac{2\cdot v}{1+u^2+v^2},\tfrac{2}{1+u^2+v^2})\]
which is called \index{stereographic projection}\emph{stereographic projection} from the plane $z=1$ to the unit sphere with center at $(0,0,1)$.
Note that the point $(u,v,1)$ and its image $(\tfrac{2\cdot u}{1+u^2+v^2},\tfrac{2\cdot v}{1+u^2+v^2},\tfrac{2}{1+u^2+v^2})$ lie on one half-line starting at the origin. %???+PIC???

Let $\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))$ be a plane curve.
Recall that the \index{surface of revolution}\emph{surface of revolution} of the curve $\gamma$ around the $x$-axis can be described as the 
image of the map 
\[(t, s)\mapsto (x(t), y(t)\cdot\cos s,y(t)\cdot\sin s).\]
For fixed $t$ or $ s$ the obtained curves are called \index{meridian}\emph{meridian} or respectively \index{parallel}\emph{parallel} of the surface; note that parallels are formed by circles in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:revolution}
Assume $\gamma$ is a closed simple smooth regular plane curve that does not intersect the $x$-axis.
Show that surface of revolution of $\gamma$ around the $x$-axis is a smooth regular surface.
\end{thm}


\section{Global parametrizations} 
A surface can be described by an embedding from a known surface to the space.

For example, consider the ellipsoid
\[\Sigma_{a,b,c}=\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}+\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}+\tfrac{z^2}{c^2}=1}\]
for some positive numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$.
Note that by \ref{prop:implicit-surface}, $\Sigma_{a,b,c}$ is a smooth regular surface.
Indeed, set $f(x,y,z)=\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}+\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}+\tfrac{z^2}{c^2}$,
then
\[\nabla f(x,y,z)=(\tfrac{2}{a^2}\cdot x,\tfrac{2}{b^2}\cdot y,\tfrac{2}{c^2}\cdot z).\]
Therefore $\nabla f\ne0$ if $f=1$; that is, $1$ is a regular value of $f$.

Note that $\Sigma_{a,b,c}$ can be defined as the image of the map $s\:\mathbb{S}^2\to\RR^3$, defined as the restriction of the following map to the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$:
\[(x,y,z)\z\mapsto (a\cdot x, b\cdot y,c\cdot z).\]

For a surface $\Sigma$, a map $s\: \Sigma \to \RR ^3$ is called a 
\emph{smooth parametrized surface} if for any chart $f\:U\to \Sigma$ 
the composition $s\circ f$ is smooth and regular;
that is, all partial derivatives $\frac{\partial^{m+n}}{\partial u^m\partial v^n}(s\circ f)$ exist and are continuous in the domain of definition and the following two vectors 
$\frac{\partial}{\partial u}(s\circ f)$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial v}(s\circ f)$ are linearly independent.

If in addition the map $s\: \Sigma \to \RR ^3$ is an embedding, then the image $\Sigma'=s(\Sigma)$ is a smooth surface.
The later follows since for any chart $f\:U\to \Sigma$ the composition $s\circ f\:U\to \Sigma'$ is a chart of $\Sigma'$. 
In this case the map $s$ is called \index{diffeomorphism}\emph{diffeomorphism} from $\Sigma$ to $\Sigma'$; the surfaces $\Sigma$ to $\Sigma'$ are called {}\emph{diffeomorphic} is there is a diffeomorphism $s\:\Sigma\to\Sigma'$.


\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{ex:star-shaped-disc}
Show that the surfaces $\Sigma$ and $\Theta$ are diffeomorphic if

\begin{subthm}{ex:plane-n}
$\Sigma$ and $\Theta$ obtained from the plane by removing $n$ points.
\end{subthm}


\begin{subthm}{ex:star-shaped-disc:smooth}
$\Sigma$ and $\Theta$ are open convex subset of a plane bounded by a smooth curves.
\end{subthm}


\begin{subthm}{ex:star-shaped-disc:nonsmooth}
$\Sigma$ and $\Theta$ are open convex subset of a plane.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{ex:star-shaped-disc:star-shaped}
$\Sigma$ and $\Theta$ are open star-shaped subset of a plane.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

Evidently the parametric definition includes the embedded surfaces defined previously --- as the domain of parameters we can take the surface itself and the identity map as $s$.
But parametrized surfaces are more general, in particular they  might  have self-intersections.

If $\Sigma$ is a known surface for example a sphere or a plane, the parameterized surface $s\:\Sigma\to\RR^3$ might be called by the same name.
For example, any embedding $s\:\mathbb{S}^2\to\RR^3$ might be called a \index{topological sphere}\emph{topological sphere}
and if $s$ is smooth and regular, then it might be called \index{smooth sphere}\emph{smooth sphere}.
(A smooth regular map $s\:\mathbb{S}^2\to\RR^3$ which is not necessary an embedding is called a \index{smooth immersion}\emph{smooth immersion}, so we can say that $s$ describes a \index{smooth immersed sphere}\emph{smooth immersed sphere}.) 
Similarly an embedding $s\:\RR^2\to\RR^3$ might be called \index{topological plane}\emph{topological plane},
and if $s$ is smooth, it might be called \index{smooth plane}\emph{smooth plane}.

\section{Tangent plane}

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:tangent-vector}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface.
A vector $\vec w$ is a \index{tangent vector}\emph{tangent vector} of $\Sigma$ at $p$ if and only if there is a curve $\gamma$ that runs in $\Sigma$ and has $\vec w$ as a velocity vector at $p$;
that is, $p=\gamma(t)$ and $\vec w=\gamma'(t)$ for some $t$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Proposition-Definition}\label{def:tangent-plane}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface and $p\in \Sigma$.
Then the set of tangent vectors of $\Sigma$ at $p$ forms a plane;
this plane is called \index{tangent plane}\emph{tangent plane} of $\Sigma$ at $p$.

Moreover if $s\:U\to \Sigma$ is a local chart and $p=s(u_p,v_p)$, then 
the tangent plane of $\Sigma$ at $p$ is spanned by vectors $s_u(u_p,v_p)$ and $s_v(u_p,v_p)$.
\end{thm}

The tangent plane to $\Sigma$ at $p$ is usually denoted by $\T_p$ or $\T_p\Sigma$.
Tangent plane $\T_p$ might be considered as a linear subspace of $\RR^3$ or as a parallel plane passing thru $p$.
In the latter case it can be interpreted as the best approximation at~$p$ of the surface $\Sigma$ by a plane;
it has \index{order of contact}\emph{first order of contact} with $\Sigma$ at $p$;
that is, $\rho(q)\z=o(|p-q|)$, where $q\in \Sigma$ and $\rho(q)$ denotes the distance from $q$ to $\T_p$.

\parit{Proof.}
Fix a chart $s$ at $p$.
Assume $\gamma$ is a smooth curve that starts at~$p$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $\gamma$ is covered by the chart;
in particular, there are smooth functions $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ such that 
\[\gamma(t)=s(u(t),v(t)).\]
Applying chain rule, we get
\[\gamma'=s_u\cdot u'+ s_v\cdot v';\]
that is, $\gamma'$ is a linear combination of $s_u$ and $s_v$.

Since the smooth functions $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ can be chosen arbitrary, any linear combination of $s_u$ and $s_v$ is a tangent vector at the corresponding point. 
\qeds


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:tangent-normal}
Let $f:\RR^3\to\RR$ be a smooth function with a regular value $0$ and $\Sigma$ be a surface described as a connected component of the set of solutions $f(x,y,z)=0$.
Show that the tangent plane $\T_p\Sigma$ is perpendicular to the gradient $\nabla_pf$ at any point $p\in\Sigma$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:vertical-tangent}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface and $p\in\Sigma$.
Fix an $(x,y,z)$-coordinates.
Show that a neighborhood of $p$ in $\Sigma$ is a graph $z=f(x,y)$ of a smooth function $f$ defined on an open subset in the $(x,y)$-plane if and only if the tangent plane $\T_p$ is not {}\emph{vertical}; that is, if $\T_p$ is not perpendicular to the $(x,y)$-plane.
\end{thm}


\section{Directional derivative}

In this section we extend the definition of directional derivative to smooth functions defined on smooth surfaces.

First let recall the standard definition of directional derivative.

Suppose $f$ is a function defined at a point $p$ in the space, and $\vec w$ is a vector.
Then directional derivative $D_{\vec w}f(p)$ is defined as the derivative at zero $h'(0)$ of the function
\[h(t)=f(p+t\cdot\vec w).\]

\begin{thm}{Proposition-Definition}\label{def:directional-derivative}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth regular surface and $f$ is a smooth function defined on $\Sigma$. 
Suppose $\gamma$ is a smooth curve in $\Sigma$ that starts at $p$ with the velocity vector $\vec{w}\in \T_p$;
that is, $\gamma(0)=p$ and $\gamma'(0)=\vec{w}$.
Then the derivative $(f\circ\gamma)'(0)$
depends only on $f$, $p$ and $\vec{w}$;
it is called \index{directional derivative}\emph{directional derivative of $f$ along $\vec{w}$ at $p$}
and denoted by
\[D_{\vec{w}}f,\quad D_{\vec{w}}f(p), \quad\text{or}\quad D_{\vec{w}}f(p)_\Sigma\] 
--- we may omit $p$ and $\Sigma$ if it is clear from the context.

Moreover, if $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ is a local chart at $p$, then 
\[D_{\vec{w}}f=a\cdot f_u+b\cdot f_v,\]
where $\vec{w}=a\cdot s_u +b\cdot s_v$. 
\end{thm}

Note that our definition agrees with standard definition of directional derivative if $\Sigma$ is a plane.
Indeed, in this case $\gamma(t)=p+\vec w\cdot t$ is a curve in $\Sigma$ that starts at $p$ with the velocity vector $\vec{w}$.
For a general surface the point $p+\vec w\cdot t$ might not lie on the surface; therefore the function $f$ might be undefined at this point; therefore the standard definition does not work.

\parit{Proof.}
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\gamma$ is covered by the chart $s$;
if not we can chop $\gamma$.
In this case 
\[\gamma(t)=s(u(t),v(t))\]
for some smooth functions $u,v$ defined in a neighborhood of $0$ such that 
$u(0)=u_p$ and $v(0)=v_p$.

Applying the chain rule, we get that
\begin{align*}
\gamma'(0)&=u'(0)\cdot s_u+v'(0)\cdot s_v
\end{align*}
at $(u_p,v_p)$.
Since $\vec{w}=\gamma'(0)$ and the vectors $s_u$, $s_v$ are linearly independent, we get that $a=u'(0)$ and $b=v'(0)$.

Applying the chain rule again, we get that
\[
(f\circ\gamma)'(0)=a\cdot f_u+b\cdot f_v.
\eqlbl{eq:f-gamma}
\]
at $(u_p,v_p)$.

Notice that the left hand side in \ref{eq:f-gamma} does not depend on the choice of the chart $s$ and the right hand side depends only on $p$, $\vec w$, $f$, and $s$. 
It follows that $(f\circ\gamma)'(0)$ depends only on $p$, $\vec w$ and $f$.

The last statement follows from \ref{eq:f-gamma}.
\qeds

\section{Linearization}

Any smooth map $ s$ from a surface $\Sigma$ to $\RR^3$ can be described by its coordinate functions 
$ s(p)=(x(p),y(p),z(p))$. notation
To take a directional derivative of the map we should take the  directional derivative of each of its coordinate function.
\[D_{\vec{w}} s\df(D_{\vec{w}}x,D_{\vec{w}}y,D_{\vec{w}}z).\]

Assume $ s$ is a smooth map from one smooth surface $\Sigma_0$ to another $\Sigma_1$ and $p\in \Sigma_0$.
Note that $D_{\vec w} s(p)\in \T_{s(p)}\Sigma_1$ for any $\vec w\in \T_p$.
Indeed choose a curve $\gamma_0$ in $\Sigma_0$ such that $\gamma_0(0)=p$ and $\gamma_0'(0)=\vec w$.
Observe that $\gamma_1= s\circ \gamma_0$ is a smooth curve in $\Sigma_1$ and 
by the definition directional derivative, we have $D_{\vec w} s(p)=\gamma_1'(0)$.
It remains to note that $\gamma_1(0)\z= s(p)$ and therefore its velocity $\gamma_1'(0)$ is in $\T_{ s(p)}\Sigma_1$.

Recall that \ref{def:directional-derivative} implies that 
$d_p s\:\vec w \mapsto D_{\vec w} s$ defines a linear map $d_p s\:\T_p\Sigma_0\to \T_{ s(p)}\Sigma_1$;
that is,
\[D_{c\cdot \vec w} s=c\cdot D_{\vec w} s(p)
\quad\text{and}\quad D_{\vec v+ \vec w} s=D_{\vec v} s(p)+ D_{\vec w} s(p)\]
for any $c\in\RR$ and $\vec v, \vec w\in\T_p$.
The map $d_p s$ is called a \index{differential of map}\emph{differential} of $s$ at $p$.

The linear map $d_p s$ can be written as a 2$\times$2-matrix $M$ in orthonormal basises of $\T_p$ and $\T_{ s(p)}\Sigma_1$.
Set $\jac_p s=|\det M|$; this value  
does not depend on the choice orthonormal basises in $\T_p$ and $\T_{ s(p)}\Sigma_1$. \label{page:|L|}

Let $ s_1\:\Sigma_1\to\Sigma_2$ be another smooth map between smooth surfaces $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$.
Suppose that ${p_1}= s(p)\in\Sigma_1$;
observe that 
\[d_p( s_1\circ s)=d_{p_1} s_1 \circ d_p s.\]
It follows that
\[\jac_p( s_1\circ s)
=
\jac_{p_1} s_1\cdot\jac_p s.\eqlbl{eq:jac-composition}\]


If $\Sigma_0$ is a domain in the $(u,v)$-plane, then the value $\jac_p s$ can be found using the following formulas 
\begin{align*}
\jac s
&=|s_v\times s_u|=
\\
&=\sqrt{\langle s_u, s_u\rangle\cdot\langle s_v, s_v\rangle -\langle s_u, s_v\rangle^2}=
\\
&=\sqrt{\det[\Jac^\top s\cdot \Jac s]}.
\end{align*}
where $\Jac s$ denotes the Jacobean matrix of $s$; it is a 2$\times$3 matrix with column vectors $s_u$ and $ s_v$.

The value $\jac_p s$ has the following geometric meaning:
if $P_0$ is a region in $\T_p$ and $P_1=(d_p s)(P_0)$, then
\[\area P_1=\jac_p s\cdot \area P_0.\]
This identity will become important in the definition of surface area.



\section{Surface integral and area}

Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface and $h\:\Sigma\to\RR$ be a smooth function.
Let us define the integral $\iint_R h$ of the function $h$ along a region $R\subset \Sigma$.
(This definition can be applied to any Borel set of $R\subset \Sigma$.)

Assume that there is a chart $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ of $\Sigma$ defined on an open set $U\subset\RR^2$ such that $R\subset s(U)$.
In this case set
\[\iint_R h\df \iint_{s^{-1}(R)} h\circ s(u,v)\cdot \jac_{(u,v)}s  \cdot du\cdot dv.\eqlbl{eq:area-def}\]
($\jac_{(u,v)}s$ is defined in previous section.)

By the substitution rule (\ref{thm:mult-substitution}), the right hand side in \ref{eq:area-def} does not depend on the choice of $s$.
That is, if $s_1\:U_1\to \Sigma$ is another chart such that $s_1(U_1)\supset R$, then 
\[\iint_{s^{-1}(R)} h\circ s(u,v)\cdot \jac_{(u,v)}s  \cdot du\cdot dv=\iint_{s_1^{-1}(R)} h\circ s_1(u,v)\cdot \jac_{(u,v)}s_1  \cdot du\cdot dv.\]
In other words, the defining identity \ref{eq:area-def} makes sense.

A general region $R$ can be subdivided into regions $R_1,R_2\dots$ such that each $R_i$ lies in the image of some chart.
After that one could define the integral along $R$ as the sum
\[\iint_Rh
\df
\iint_{R_1}h+\iint_{R_2}h+\dots\]
It is straightforward to check that the value $\iint_Rh$ does not depend on the choice of subdivision.

The area of a region $R$ in a smooth surface $\Sigma$ is defined as the surface integral 
\[\area R=\iint_R 1.\]

The following proposition provides a substitution rule for surface integral.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:surface-integral}
Suppose $ s\:\Sigma_0\to \Sigma_1$ is a smooth parameterization of a smooth surface $\Sigma_1$ by  a smooth surface $\Sigma_0$.
Then for any region $R\subset \Sigma_0$ and any smooth function $f\:\Sigma_1\to\RR$ we have
\[\iint_R (f\circ s)\cdot \jac  s=\int_{ s(R)}f.\]
In particular, if $f\equiv 1$, we have
\[\iint_R \jac  s=\area [ s(R)].\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Follows from \ref{eq:jac-composition} and the definiton of surface integral.
\qeds

\parbf{Remark.}
The notion of area of surface is closely related to length of curve.
However, to define length we uses a different idea --- it was defined as the least upper bound on the lengths of inscribed polygonal lines.
It turns out that analogous definition does not work even for very simple surfaces.
Section \ref{sec:schwarz-boot} describes the so called \index{Schwarz's boot}\emph{Schwarz's boot} --- a classical example of that type.


\section{(Tangent vectors as functionals)}

In this section we introduce a more conceptual way to define tangent vectors.
We will not use this approach in the sequel, but it is better to know about it.

A tangent vector $\vec w\in \T_p$ to a smooth surface $\Sigma$ 
defines a linear functional%
\footnote{Term \index{functional}\emph{functional} is used for functions that take a function as an argument and return a number.} $D_{\vec w}$
that takes a smooth function $\phi$ on $\Sigma$ and spits the directional derivative $D_{\vec w}\phi$.
It is straightforward to check that the functional $D$ obeys the product rule:
\[D_{\vec w}(\phi\cdot\psi)=(D_{\vec w}\phi)\cdot \psi(p)+\phi(p)\cdot(D_{\vec w}\psi).
\eqlbl{eq:tangent-functional}\]

It turns out that the tangent vector $\vec w$ is completely determined by the functional $D_{\vec w}$.
Moreover tangent vectors at $p$ can be defined as linear functionals on the space of smooth functions
that satisfy the product rule \ref{eq:tangent-functional}.

This new definition is less intuitive, but it is more convenient to use since it grabs the key algebraic property of tangent vectors.
(It is an art to make a right definition.) 
Many statements admit simpler proofs with this approach, for example linearity of the map $\vec w\mapsto D_{\vec w}f$ becomes a tautology.


\section{Normal vector and orientation}
A unit vector that is normal to $\T_p$ is usually denoted by $\Norm_p$;
it is uniquely defined up to sign.

A surface $\Sigma$ is called \index{oriented surface}\emph{oriented} if it is equipped with a unit normal vector field $\Norm$;
that is, a continuous map $p\mapsto \Norm_p$ such that $\Norm_p\perp\T_p$ and $|\Norm_p|=1$ for any $p$.
The choice of the field $\Norm$ is called the \index{orientation}\emph{orientation} on $\Sigma$.
A surface $\Sigma$ is called \index{orientable}\emph{orientable} if it can be oriented.
Note that each orientable surface admits two orientations $\Norm$ and $-\Norm$. %???

M\"obius strip shown on the diagram gives an example of a nonorientable surface --- there is no choice of normal vector field that is continuous along the middle of the strip (it changes the sign if you try to go around).


Note that each surface is locally orientable.
In fact each chart $f(u,v)$ admits an orientation 
\[\Norm=
\frac{f_u\times f_v}
{\left|f_u\times f_v\right|}.\]
Indeed the vectors $f_u$ and $f_v$ are tangent vectors at $p$; 
since they are linearly independent, their vector product does not vanish and it is perpendicular to the tangent plane.
Evidently $(u,v)\mapsto \Norm(u,v)$ is a continuous map.
Therefore $\Norm$ is a unit normal field. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:implicit-orientable}
Let $h:\RR^3\to\RR$ be a smooth function with a regular value $0$ and $\Sigma$ is a surface described as a connected component of the set of solutions $h(x,y,z)=0$.
Show that $\Sigma$ is orientable.
\end{thm}

Recall that any proper surface without boundary in the Euclidean space divides it into two connected components (\ref{clm:proper-divides}).
Therefore we can choose the unit normal field on any smooth proper surfaces that points into one of the components of the complement.
Therefore we obtain the following observation. 

\begin{thm}{Observation}
Any smooth open or closed surface in Euclidean space is oriented.
\end{thm}

In particular it follows that the M\"obius strip cannot be extended to an open or closed smooth surface without boundary.

\section{Spherical map}

Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth oriented surface with unit normal field $\Norm$.
The map $\Norm\:\Sigma\to \mathbb{S}^2$ defined by $p\mapsto \Norm_p$ is called \index{spherical map}\emph{spherical map} or \index{Gauss map}\emph{Gauss map}.

For surfaces, the spherical map plays essentially the same role as the tangent indicatrix for curves.

\section{Sections}

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{ex:plane-section}
Show that any closed set in a plane can appear as an intersection of this plane with an open smooth regular surface.  
\end{thm}

The exercise above says that plane sections of a smooth regular surface might look complicated.
The following lemma makes it possible to perturb the plane so that the section becomes nice.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:reg-section}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth regular surface.
Suppose $f\:\RR^3\z\to\RR$ is a smooth function.
Then for any constant $r_0$ there is an arbitrarily close value $r$ such that 
each connected component of the intersection of the level set $L_{r}=f^{-1}\{r\}$ with
$\Sigma$ is a smooth regular curve.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
The surface $\Sigma$ can be covered by a countable set of charts $s_i\:U_i\to \Sigma$.
Note that the composition $f\circ s_i$ is a smooth function for any $i$.
By Sard's lemma (\ref{lem:sard}), almost all real numbers $r$ are regular values of each $f\circ s_i$.

Fix such a value $r$ sufficiently close to $r_0$ and consider the level set $L_r$ described by the equation $f(x,y,z)=r$.
Any point in the intersection $\Sigma\cap L_r$ lies in the image of one of the charts.
From above it admits a neighborhood which is a regular smooth curve;
hence the result.\qeds

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface.
Then for any plane $\Pi$ there is a parallel plane $\Pi'$ that lies arbitrary close to $\Pi$ and such that the intersection $\Sigma\cap\Pi$ is a union of disjoint smooth curves.
\end{thm}
