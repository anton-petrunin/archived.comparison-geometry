\section*{Topological surfaces}

We will be mostly interested in smooth regular surfaces defined in the following section.
However few times we will use the following general definition.

A connected subset $\Sigma$ in the Euclidean space $\RR^3$
is called a \emph{topological surface} (more precisely an \emph{embedded surface without boundary}) 
if any point of $p\in \Sigma$ admits a neighborhood $W$ in $\Sigma$ which is \emph{homeomorphic} to an open subset in the Euclidean plane;
that is, there is an injective continuous map $U\to W$ from an open set $U\subset \RR^2$ such that its inverse $W\to U$ is also continuous.


\section*{Smooth surfaces}

Recall that a function $f$ of two variables $x$ and $y$ is called \emph{smooth} if all its partial derivatives $\frac{\partial^{m+n}}{\partial x^m\partial y^n}f$ are defined and are continuous in the domain of definition of $f$. 

A connected set $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ is called a \emph{smooth surface} (or more precisely \emph{smooth regular embedded surface}) if it can be described locally as a graph of a smooth function in an appropriate coordinate system.\label{page:def-smooth-surface} %???+regular???spoken term

More precisely, for any point $p\in \Sigma$ one can choose a coordinate system $(x,y,z)$ and a neighborhood $U\ni p$ such that
the intersection $W=U\cap \Sigma$ is formed by a graph $z=f(x,y)$ of a smooth function $f$ defined in an open domain of the $(x,y)$-plane.

\parbf{Examples.}
The simplest example of a surface is the $(x,y)$-plane 
\[\Pi=\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{z=0}.\]
The plane $\Pi$ is a surface since
it can be described as the graph of the function $f(x,y)=0$.

All other planes are surfaces as well since one can choose a coordinate system so that it becomes the $(x,y)$-plane.
We can also present a plane as a graph of a linear function 
$f(x,y)=a\cdot x+b\cdot y+c$ for some constants $a$, $b$ and $c$
(assuming the plane is not perpendicular to the $(x,y)$-plane).

A more interesting example is the unit sphere 
\[\SS^2=\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{x^2+y^2+z^2=1}.\]
This set is not the graph of any function,
but $\SS^2$ is locally a graph;
it can be covered by the following 6 graphs:
\begin{align*}
z&=f_\pm(x,y)=\pm \sqrt{1-x^2-y^2},
\\
y&=g_\pm(x,z)=\pm \sqrt{1-x^2-z^2},
\\
x&=h_\pm(y,z)=\pm \sqrt{1-y^2-z^2},
\end{align*}
where each function $f_\pm,g_\pm,h_\pm$ is defined in an open unit disc.
Any point $p\in\SS^2$ lies in one of these graphs, therefore $\SS^2$ is a smooth surface.

\section*{Surfaces with boundary}
A connected subset in a surface that is bounded by one or more 
curves is called \emph{surface with boundary}; in this case the collection of curves is called the \emph{boundary line} of the surface.

When we say \emph{surface} we usually mean a \emph{smooth regular surface without boundary};
we may use the terms \emph{surface without boundary} if we need to emphasise it;
otherwise we may use the term \emph{surface with possibly nonempty boundary}.

\section*{Proper, closed and open surfaces}
If the surface $\Sigma$ is formed by a closed set, then it is called \emph{proper}.
For example, paraboloids %???+PICs
\[z=x^2+y^2,\quad\quad z=x^2-y^2\]
or sphere 
\[x^2+y^2+z^2=1\]
are proper surfaces, while the
open disc 
\[\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{x^2+y^2<1,\  z=0}\]
is not proper; this set is neither open nor closed.

A compact surface without boundary is called \emph{closed}
(this term is closely related to \emph{closed curve} but has nothing to do with \emph{closed set}).

A proper noncompact surface without boundary is called \emph{open} (again the term \emph{open set} is not relevant).

For example, any paraboloid 
is an open surface; 
sphere is a closed surface.

Note that any proper surface without boundary is either closed or open.

The following claim is a two-dimesional analog of \ref{ex:proper-curve};
hopefully it is intuitively obvious. 
Its proof is not at all trivial; a standard proof uses the so-called \emph{Alexander's duality} which is a classical technique in algebraic topology.
We omit its proof. %???+ref

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:proper-divides}
The complement of any proper topological surface without boundary (or, equivalently any open or closed topological surface) has exactly two connected components. 
\end{thm}

\section*{Implicitly defined surfaces}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:implicit-surface}
Let $f\:\RR^3\to \RR$ be a smooth function.
Suppose that $0$ is a regular value of $f$;
that is, $\nabla_p f\ne 0$ if $f(p)=0$.
Then any connected component $\Sigma$ of the set of solutions of the equation $f(x,y,z)=0$ is a surface.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Fix $p\in\Sigma$.
Since $\nabla_p f\ne 0$ we have 
\[\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}(p)\ne 0,\quad \tfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}(p)\ne 0,\quad \text{or}\quad\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial z}(p)\ne 0.\]
We may assume $\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial z}(p)\ne 0$;
otherwise permute the coordinates $x,y,z$.

The implicit function theorem (\ref{thm:imlicit}) implies that a neighborhood of $p$ in $\Sigma$ is the graph $z=h(x,y)$ of a smooth function $h$ defined on an open domain in $\RR^2$.
It remains to apply the definition of smooth surface (page \pageref{page:def-smooth-surface}).
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:hyperboloinds}
Describe the set of real numbers $\ell$
such that the equation
\begin{align*}
x^2+y^2-z^2&=\ell
\end{align*}
describes a smooth regular surface.
\end{thm}

\section*{Local parametrizations}

Let $U$ be an open domain in $\RR^2$ and $s\:U\to \RR^3$ be a smooth map.
We say that $s$ is regular if its Jacobian has maximal rank;
in this case it means that the vectors $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}$ and $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}$ are linearly independent at any $(u,v)\in U$;
equivalently $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}\times\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}\ne 0$, where $\times$ denotes the vector product.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:graph-chart}
If $s\:U\to \RR^3$ is a smooth regular embedding %???is it defined???
of an open connected set $U\subset \RR^2$, then its image $\Sigma=s(U)$ is a smooth surface.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Set 
\[s(u,v)=(x_s(u,v),y_s(u,v),z_s(u,v)).\]
Since $s$ is regular, its Jacobian matrix
\[
\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.3}
\begin{pmatrix}
\tfrac{\partial x_s}{\partial u}&\tfrac{\partial x_s}{\partial v}\\
\tfrac{\partial y_s}{\partial u}&\tfrac{\partial y_s}{\partial v}\\
\tfrac{\partial z_s}{\partial u}&\tfrac{\partial z_s}{\partial v}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
has rank two at any pint $(u,v)\in U$.

Fix a point $p\in \Sigma$; by shifting the coordinate system we may assume that $p$ is the origin.
Permuting the coordinates $x,y,z$ if necessary, we may assume that 
the matrix 
\[
\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.3}
\begin{pmatrix}
\tfrac{\partial x_s}{\partial u}&\tfrac{\partial x_s}{\partial v}\\
\tfrac{\partial y_s}{\partial u}&\tfrac{\partial y_s}{\partial v}
\end{pmatrix},
\]
which is the Jacobian matix of the map $(u,v)\mapsto (x_s(u,v),y_s(u,v))$, 
is invertible.

The inverse function theorem implies that there is a smooth regular function $h$ defined on an open set $W\ni 0$ in the $(x,y)$-plane
such that 
\[(x_s\circ h)(x,y)=x\quad\text{and}\quad (y_s\circ h)(x,y)=y\]
for any $(x,y)\in W$.
It follows that the graph $z=z_s\circ h(x,y)$ for $(x,y)\in W$ is a subset in $\Sigma$.
Clearly this graph is open in $\Sigma$. %???why
Since $p$ is arbitrary, we get that $\Sigma$ is a surface.
\qeds

If we have $s$ and $\Sigma$ as in the proposition, then we say that $s$ is a \emph{parametrization} of the surface $\Sigma$. 

Not all the smooth surfaces can be described by such a parametrization;
for example the sphere $\SS^2$ cannot.
But any smooth surface $\Sigma$ admits a local parametrization; that is, any point $p\in\Sigma$ admits an open neighborhood $W\subset \Sigma$ with a smooth regular parametrization~$s$.
In this case any point in $W$ can be described by two parameters, usually denoted by $u$ and $v$, 
which are called \emph{local coordinates} at $p$.
The map $s$ is called a \emph{chart} of $\Sigma$.

If $W$ is a graph $z=h(x,y)$ of a smooth function $h$, then the map 
\[s\:(u,v)\mapsto (u,v,h(u,v))\] is a chart.
Indeed, $s$ has an inverse $(u,v,h(u,v))\mapsto (u,v)$ which is continuous;
that is, $s$ is an embedding.
Further,
$\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}=(1,0,\tfrac{\partial h}{\partial u})$ and $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}=(0,1,\tfrac{\partial h}{\partial v})$. 
Whence $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}$ and $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}$ are linearly independent;
that is, $s$ is a regular map.

Note that from \ref{prop:graph-chart}, we obtain the following corollary.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
A connected set $\Sigma\subset \RR^3$ is a smooth regular surface if $\Sigma$ has a local parametrization by a smooth regular map at any point $p\in\Sigma$.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:inversion}
Consider the following map 
\[s(u,v)=(\tfrac{2\cdot u}{1+u^2+v^2},\tfrac{2\cdot v}{1+u^2+v^2},\tfrac{2}{1+u^2+v^2}).\]
Show that $s$ is a chart of the unit sphere centered at $(0,0,1)$; describe the image of $s$.
\end{thm}

The map $s$ in the exercise can be visualized using the following map
\[(u,v,1)\mapsto (\tfrac{2\cdot u}{1+u^2+v^2},\tfrac{2\cdot v}{1+u^2+v^2},\tfrac{2}{1+u^2+v^2})\]
which is called \emph{stereographic projection} from the plane $z=1$ to the unit sphere with center at $(0,0,1)$
Note that the point $(u,v,1)$ and its image $(\tfrac{2\cdot u}{1+u^2+v^2},\tfrac{2\cdot v}{1+u^2+v^2},\tfrac{2}{1+u^2+v^2})$ lie on one half-line starting at the origin. %???+PIC???

Let $\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))$ be a plane curve.
Recall that the \emph{surface of revolution} of the curve $\gamma$ around the $x$-axis can be described as the 
image of the map 
\[(t,\theta)\mapsto (x(t), y(t)\cdot\cos\theta,y(t)\cdot\sin\theta).\]
For fixed $t$ or $\theta$ the obtained curves are called \emph{meridian} or correspondingly \emph{parallel} of the surface of revolution; note that parallels are formed by circles in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:revolution}
Assume $\gamma$ is a closed simple smooth regular plane curve that does not intersect the $x$-axis.
Show that surface of revolution of $\gamma$ around the $x$-axis is a smooth regular surface.
\end{thm}


\section*{Global parametrizations} 
A surface can be described by an embedding from a known surface to the space.

For example, consider the ellipsoid
\[\Sigma_{a,b,c}=\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}+\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}+\tfrac{z^2}{c^2}=1}\]
for some positive numbers $a,b,c$.
Note that by \ref{prop:implicit-surface}, $\Sigma_{a,b,c}$ is a smooth regular surface.
Indeed, set $f(x,y,z)=\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}+\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}+\tfrac{z^2}{c^2}$,
then
\[\nabla f(x,y,z)=(\tfrac{2}{a^2}\cdot x,\tfrac{2}{b^2}\cdot y,\tfrac{2}{c^2}\cdot z).\]
Therefore $\nabla f\ne0$ if $f=1$; that is, $1$ is a regular value of $f$.
Since $\Sigma_{a,b,c}$ it is a smooth regular surface.

Note that $\Sigma_{a,b,c}$ can be defined as the image of the map $s\:\SS^2\to\RR^3$, defined as the restriction of the map $(x,y,z)\z\mapsto (a\cdot x, b\cdot y,c\cdot z)$ to the unit sphere $\SS^2$.

For a surface $\Sigma$, a map $s: \Sigma \to \RR ^3$ is called a 
\emph{smooth parametrized surface} if for any chart $f\:U\to \Sigma$ 
the composition $s\circ f$ is smooth and regular;
that is, all partial derivatives $\frac{\partial^{m+n}}{\partial u^m\partial v^n}(s\circ f)$ exist and are continuous in the domain of definition and the following two vectors 
$\frac{\partial}{\partial u}(s\circ f)$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial v}(s\circ f)$ are linearly independent.

Evidently the parametric definition includes the embedded surfaces defined previously --- as the domain of parameters we can take the surface itself and the identity map as $s$.
But parametrized surfaces are more general, in particular they  might  have self-intersections.

If $\Sigma$ is a known surface for example a sphere or a plane, the parametrized surface $s\:\Sigma\to\RR^3$ might be called by the same name.
For example, any embedding $s\:\SS^2\to\RR^3$ might be called a topological sphere
and if $s$ is smooth and regular, then it might be called smooth sphere.
(A smooth regular map $s\:\SS^2\to\RR^3$ which is not necessary an embedding is called a \emph{smooth regular immersion}, so we can say that $s$ describes a smooth immersed sphere.) 
Similarly an embedding $s\:\RR^2\to\RR^3$ might be called topological plane,
and if $s$ is smooth, it might be called smooth plane.

\section*{Tangent plane}

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface.
A vector $\vec w$ is a \emph{tangent vector} of $\Sigma$ at $p$ if and only if there is a curve $\gamma$ that runs in $\Sigma$ and has $\vec w$ as a velocity vector at $p$;
that is, $p=\gamma(t)$ and $\vec w=\gamma'(t)$ for some $t$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Proposition-Definition}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface and $p\in \Sigma$.
Then the set of tangent vectors of $\Sigma$ at $p$ forms a plane;
this plane is called \emph{tangent plane} of $\Sigma$ at $p$.

Moreover if $s\:U\to \Sigma$ is a local chart and $p=s(u_p,v_p)$, then 
the tangent plane of $\Sigma$ at $p$ is spanned by vectors $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}(u_p,v_p)$ and $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}(u_p,v_p)$.
\end{thm}

The tangent plane to $\Sigma$ at $p$ is usually denoted by $\T_p$ or $\T_p\Sigma$.
Tangent plane $\T_p$ might be considered as a linear subspace of $\RR^3$ or as a parallel plane passing thru $p$.
In the latter case it can be interpreted as the best approximation of the surface $\Sigma$ by a plane at~$p$;
it has \emph{first order of contact} with $\Sigma$ at $p$;
that is, $\rho(q)\z=o(|p-q|)$, where $q\in \Sigma$ and $\rho(q)$ denotes the distance from $q$ to $\T_p$.

\parit{Proof.}
Fix a chart $s$ at $p$.
Assume $\gamma$ is a smooth curve that starts at~$p$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $\gamma$ is covered by the chart;
in particular, there are smooth function $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ such that 
\[\gamma(t)=s(u(t),v(t)).\]
Applying chain rule, we get
\[\gamma'=\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}\cdot u'+ \tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}\cdot v';\]
that is, $\gamma'$ is a linear combination of $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}$ and $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}$.

Since the functions $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ can be chousen arbitrary, we have that any linear combination of $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}$ and $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}$ is a tangent vector at the corresponding point. 
\qeds


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:tangent-normal}
Let $f:\RR^3\to\RR$ be a smooth function with a regular value $0$ and $\Sigma$ be a surface described as a connected component of the set of solutions $f(x,y,z)=0$.
Show that the tangent plane $\T_p\Sigma$ is perpendicular to the gradient $\nabla_pf$ at any point $p\in\Sigma$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:vertical-tangent}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface and $p\in\Sigma$.
Fix an $(x,y,z)$-coordinates.
Show that a neighborhood of $p$ in $\Sigma$ is a graph $z=f(x,y)$ of a smooth function $f$ defined on an open subset in the $(x,y)$-plane if and only if the tangent plane $\T_p$ is not a \emph{vertical plane}; that is, if the projection of $\T_p$ to the $(x,y)$-plane does not degenerate to a line.
\end{thm}


\section*{Directional derivative}

In this section we extend the definition of directional derivative to smooth functions defined on smooth surfaces.

\begin{thm}{Proposition-Definition}\label{def:directional-derivative}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth regular surface and $f$ is a smooth function defined on $\Sigma$. 
Suppose $\gamma$ is a smooth curve in $\Sigma$ that starts at $p$ with the velocity vector $\vec{w}\in \T_p$;
that is $\gamma(0)=p$ and $\gamma'(0)=\vec{w}$.
Then the derivative $(f\circ\gamma)'(0)$
depends only on $f$, $p$ and $\vec{w}$;
it is called \emph{directional derivative of $f$ along $\vec{w}$ at $p$}
and denoted by
\[D_{\vec{w}}f,\quad(D_{\vec{w}})f(p), \quad\text{or}\quad (D_{\vec{w}})f(p)_\Sigma\] 
--- we may omit $p$ and $\Sigma$ if it is clear from the context.

Moreover, if $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ is a local chart at $p=s(u_p,v_p)$, and $\vec{w}=a\cdot \tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}(u_p,v_p)+b\cdot \tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}(u_p,v_p)$, then 
\[D_{\vec{w}}f(p)=a\cdot\tfrac{\partial f\circ s}{\partial u}(u_p,v_p)+b\cdot \tfrac{\partial f\circ s}{\partial v}(u_p,v_p).\]

\end{thm}

Note that our definition agrees with standard definition of directional derivative if $\Sigma$ is a plane.
Indeed, in this case $\gamma(t)=p+\vec w\cdot t$ is a curve in $\Sigma$ that starts at $p$ with the velocity vector $\vec{w}$.
For a general surface the point $p+\vec w\cdot t$ might not lie on the surface; therefore the function $f$ might be undefined at this point; therefore the standard definition will not work.

\parit{Proof.}
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\gamma$ is covered by the chart $s$;
if not we can chop $\gamma$.
In this case 
\[\gamma(t)=s(u(t),v(t))\]
for some smooth functions $u,v$ defined in a neighborhood of $0$ such that 
$u(0)=u_p$ and $v(0)=v_p$.

Applying the chain rule, we get that
\begin{align*}
\gamma'(0)&=u'(0)\cdot \tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}(u_p,v_p)+v'(0)\cdot \tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}(u_p,v_p).
\end{align*}
Since $\vec{w}=\gamma'(0)$ and the vectors $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}$, $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}$ are linearly independent, we get that $a=u'(0)$ and $b=v'(0)$.

Applying the chain rule again, we get that
\[
(f\circ\gamma)'(0)=a\cdot \tfrac{\partial f\circ s}{\partial u}(u_p,v_p)+b\cdot \tfrac{\partial f\circ s}{\partial v}(u_p,v_p).
\eqlbl{eq:f-gamma}
\]

Notice that the left hand side in \ref{eq:f-gamma} does not depend on the choice of the chart $s$ and the right hand side depends only on $p$, $\vec w$, $f$, and $s$. 
It follows that $(f\circ\gamma)'(0)$ depends only on $p$, $\vec w$ and $f$.

The last statement follows from \ref{eq:f-gamma}.
\qeds

Any smooth map $f$ from a surface $\Sigma$ to $\RR^3$ can be described by its coordinate functions 
$f(p)=(f_x(p),f_y(p),f_z(p))$.
To take a directional derivative of the map we should take the  directional derivative of each of its coordinate function.
\[D_{\vec{w}}f\df(D_{\vec{w}}f_x,D_{\vec{w}}f_y,D_{\vec{w}}f_z).\]

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:differential-range}
Assume $f$ is a smooth map from one smooth surface $\Sigma_0$ to another $\Sigma_1$ and $p\in \Sigma_0$.
Show that $D_{\vec w}f(p)\in \T_{f(p)}\Sigma_1$ for any $\vec w\in \T_p$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:linerity}
Assume $f$ is a smooth function from one smooth surface $\Sigma$.
Show that the map $\vec w \mapsto D_{\vec w}f(p)$ defined for $\vec w\in \T_p$ is linear;
that is,
$D_{c\cdot \vec w}f=c\cdot D_{\vec w}f(p)$
and 
$D_{\vec v+ \vec w}f=D_{\vec v}f(p)+ D_{\vec w}f(p)$
for any $c\in\RR$ and $\vec v, \vec w\in\T_p$.
\end{thm}


\section*{Tangent vectors as functionals*}

In this section we introduce a more conceptual way to define tangent vectors.
We will not use this approach in the sequel, but it is better to know about it.

A tangent vector $\vec w\in \T_p$ to a smooth surface $\Sigma$ 
defines a linear functional%
\footnote{Term \emph{functional} is used for functions that take a function as an argument and return a number.} $D_{\vec w}$
that takes a smooth function $\phi$ on $\Sigma$ and spits the directional derivative $D_{\vec w}\phi$.
It is straightforward to check the product rule:
\[D_{\vec w}(\phi\cdot\psi)=(D_{\vec w}\phi)\cdot \psi(p)+\phi(p)\cdot(D_{\vec w}\psi).
\eqlbl{eq:tangent-functional}\]

It turns out that the tangent vector $\vec w$ is completely determined by the functional $D_{\vec w}$.
Moreover tangent vectors at $p$ can be defined as linear functionals on the space of smooth functions
that satisfy the product rule \ref{eq:tangent-functional}.

This new definition is less intuitive, but it is more convenient to use since it grabs the key algebraic property of tangent vectors.
Many statements admit simpler proofs with this approach, for example linearity of the map $\vec w\mapsto D_{\vec w}f$ (\ref{ex:linerity}) becomes a tautology.


\section*{Normal vector and orientation}
A unit vector that is normal to $\T_p$ is usually denoted by $\Norm_p$;
it is uniquely defined up to sign.

A surface $\Sigma$ is called \emph{oriented} if it is equipped with a unit normal vector field $\Norm$;
that is, a continuous map $p\mapsto \Norm_p$ such that $\Norm_p\perp\T_p$ and $|\Norm_p|=1$ for any $p$.
The choice of the field $\Norm$ is called the \emph{orientation} on $\Sigma$.
A surface $\Sigma$ is called \emph{orientable} if it can be oriented.
Note that each orientable surface admits two orientations $\Norm$ and $-\Norm$. %???

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{40 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{asy/moebius}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

M\"obius strip shown on the diagram gives an example of a nonorientable surface --- there is no choice of normal vector field that is continuous along the middle of the strip, 
when you go around it changes the sign.

Note that each surface is locally orientable.
In fact each chart $f(u,v)$ admits an orientation 
\[\Norm=
\frac{\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}\times \tfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}}
{\left|\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}\times \tfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}\right|}.\]
Indeed the vectors $\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial u}$ and $\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial v}$ are tangent vectors at $p$; 
since they are linearly independent, their vector product does not vanish and it is perpendicular to the tangent plane.
Evidently $(u,v)\mapsto \Norm(u,v)$ is a continuous map.
Therefore $\Norm$ is a unit normal field. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:implicit-orientable}
Let $h:\RR^3\to\RR$ be a smooth function with a regular value $0$ and $\Sigma$ is a surface described as a connected component of the set of solutions $h(x,y,z)=0$.
Show that $\Sigma$ is orientable.
\end{thm}

Recall that any proper surface without boundary in the Euclidean space divides it into two connected components (\ref{clm:proper-divides}).
Therefore we can choose the unit normal field on any smooth proper surfaces that points into one of the components of the complement.
Therefore we obtain the following observation. 

\begin{thm}{Observation}
Any smooth open or closed surface in Euclidean space is oriented.
\end{thm}

In particular it follows that the M\"obius strip cannot be extended to an open or closed smooth surface without boundary.

Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth oriented surface with unit normal field $\Norm$.
The map $\Norm\:\Sigma\to \SS^2$ defined by $p\mapsto \Norm_p$ is called \emph{spherical map} or \emph{Gauss map}.

For surfaces, the spherical map plays essentially the same role as the tangent indicatrix for curves.

\section*{Plane sections}

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}
Show that any closed set in the plane can appear as an intersection of this plane with an open smooth regular surface.  
\end{thm}

As a consequence of the exercise above, the plane sections of a smooth regular surface might look complicated.
The following lemma makes it possible to perturb the plane so that the section becomes nice.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:reg-section}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth regular surface.
Then for any plane $\Pi$ there is an arbitrarily close parallel plane $\Pi'$ such that 
each connected component of the intersection $\Sigma\cap \Pi'$ is a smooth regular curve.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume $\Pi$ is described by equation $f(x,y,z)=r_0$, where
\[f(x,y,z)=a\cdot x+b\cdot y+c\cdot z.\] 
The surface $\Sigma$ can be covered by a countable set of charts $s_i\:U_i\to \Sigma$.
Note that the composition $f\circ s_i$ is a smooth function for any $i$.
By Sard's lemma (\ref{lem:sard}), almost all real numbers $r$ are regular values of each $f\circ s_i$.

Fix such a value $r$ sufficiently close to $r_0$ and consider the plane $\Pi'$ described by the equation $f(x,y,z)=r$.
Note that $\Pi'\parallel \Pi$ and is arbitrarily close to it.
Any point in the intersection $\Sigma\cap\Pi'$ lies in the image of one of the charts.
From above it admits a neighborhood which is a regular smooth curve;
hence the result.\qeds
