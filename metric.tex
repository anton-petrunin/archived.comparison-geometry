\chapter{Review}

Here we state and discuss results from different branches of mathematics which were used further in the book.
The reader is not expected to know proofs of these statements, but it is better to check that his intuition agrees with each.  

\section{Metric spaces}

\emph{Metric} is a function that returns a real value $\Dist(x,y)$ for any pair $x,y$ in a given nonempty set $\mathcal X$  and satisfies the following axioms for any triple $x,y,z$:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item\label{def:metric-space:a} Positiveness: 
$$\Dist(x,y)\ge 0.$$
\item\label{def:metric-space:b} $x=y$ if and only if 
$$\Dist(x,y)=0.$$
\item\label{def:metric-space:c} Symmetry: $$\Dist(x, y) = \Dist(y, x).$$
\item\label{def:metric-space:d} Triangle inequality: 
$$\Dist(x, z) \le \Dist(x, y) + \Dist(y, z).$$
\end{enumerate}

A set with a metric is called \emph{metric space} and the elements of the set are called \emph{points}.

\parbf{Shortcut for distance.}
Usually we consider only one metric on a set, therefore we can denote the metric space and its underlying set by the same letter, say $\mathcal X$.
In this case we also use a shortcut notations $|x-y|$ or  $|x-y|_\mathcal X$ for the \emph{distance $\Dist(x,y)$ from $x$ to $y$ in $\mathcal X$}.
For example, the triangle inequality can be written as 
$$|x-z|_{\mathcal X}\le |x-y|_{\mathcal X}+|y-z|_{\mathcal X}.$$

\parbf{Examples.}
Euclidean space and plane as well as real line will be the most important examples of metric spaces for us.
In these examples the introduced notation $|x-y|$ for the distance from $x$ to $y$ has perfect sense as a norm of the vector $x-y$.
However, in general metric space the expression $x-y$ has no sense, but anyway we use expression $|x-y|$ for the distance.

If we say \emph{plane} or \emph{space} we mean \emph{Eucledean} plane or space.
However the plane (as well as the space) admits many other metrics, for example the so called Manhattan metric from the following exercise.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Consider the function
$$\Dist(p,q)=|x_p-x_q|+|y_p-y_q|,$$
where $p=(x_p,y_p)$ and $q=(x_q,y_q)$ are points in the coordinate plane $\RR^2$.
Show that $\Dist$ is a metric on $\RR^2$.
\end{thm}

Let us mention another example: the \emph{discrete space} --- arbitrary nonempty set $\mathcal X$ with the metric defined as $|x\z-y|_{\mathcal X}=0$ if $x=y$ and $|x-y|_{\mathcal X}=1$ otherwise.

\parbf{Subspaces.}
Any subset of a metric space is also a metric space, by restricting the original metric to the subset;
the obtained metric space is called a \emph{subspace}.
In particular, all subsets of Euclidean space are metric spaces.

\parbf{Balls.}
Given a point $p$ in a metric space ${\mathcal X}$ and a real number $R\ge 0$, the set of points $x$ on the distance less then $R$ (or at most $R$) from $p$ is called open (or correspondingly closed) ball of radius $R$ with center at $p$.
The \emph{open ball} is denoted as $B(p,R)$ or $B(p,R)_{\mathcal X}$;
the second notation is used if we need to emphasize that the ball lies in the metric space $\mathcal X$.
Formally speaking
\[B(p,R)=B(p,R)_{\mathcal X}=\set{x\in \mathcal X}{|x-p|_{\mathcal X}< R}.\]
Analogously, the \emph{closed ball} is denoted as $\bar B[p,R]$ or $\bar B[p,R]_{\mathcal X}$ and
\[\bar B[p,R]=\bar B[p,R]_{\mathcal X}=\set{x\in \mathcal X}{|x-p|_{\mathcal X}\le R}.\]

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:B2inB1}
Let $\mathcal X$ be a metric space.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that if $\bar B[p,2]\subset \bar B[q,1]$
for some points $p,q\in \mathcal X$, then $\bar B[p,2]= \bar B[q,1]$.
\item Construct a metric space $\mathcal X$ with two points $p$ and $q$ such that
$B(p,\tfrac32)\subset B(q,1)$ and the inclusions is strict.
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}



\section{Continuity}

In this section we will extend standard notions from calculus to the metric spaces.

\begin{thm}{Definition}
 Let ${\mathcal X}$ be a metric space.
A sequence of points $x_1, x_2, \ldots$ in ${\mathcal X}$ is called \emph{convergent}\index{convergent}
if there is 
$x_\infty\in {\mathcal X}$ such that $|x_\infty -x_n|\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$.  
That is, for every $\eps > 0$, there is a natural number $N$ such that for all $n \ge N$, we have $$|x_\infty-x_n| < \eps.$$

In this case we say that the sequence $(x_n)$ \emph{converges} to $x_\infty$, 
or $x_\infty$ is the \emph{limit} of the sequence $(x_n)$.
Notationally, we write $x_n\to x_\infty$ as $n\to\infty$
or $x_\infty=\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let ${\mathcal X}$ and ${\mathcal Y}$ be metric spaces.
A map $f\:{\mathcal X}\to {\mathcal Y}$ is called \emph{continuous} if for any convergent sequence $x_n\to x_\infty$ in ${\mathcal X}$,
%the sequence $y_n\z=f(x_n)$ converges to $y_\infty=f(x_\infty)$ in ${\mathcal Y}$.
we have $f(x_n) \to f(x_\infty)$ in ${\mathcal Y}$.

Equivalently, $f\:{\mathcal X}\to {\mathcal Y}$ is continuous if for any $x\in {\mathcal X}$ and any $\eps>0$,
there is $\delta>0$ such that 
$$|x-x'|_{\mathcal X}<\delta\ \text{ implies }\ |f(x)-f(x')|_{\mathcal Y}<\eps.$$
%$$|x-x'|_{\mathcal X}<\delta\ \Rightarrow\ |f(x)-f(x')|_{\mathcal Y}<\eps.$$

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let ${\mathcal X}$ and ${\mathcal Y}$ be metric spaces $f\:{\mathcal X}\to {\mathcal Y}$ is \emph{distance non-expanding map}; that is, 
\[|f(x)-f(x')|_{\mathcal Y}\le |x-x'|_{\mathcal X}\]
for any $x,x'\in \mathcal X$.
Show that $f$ is continuous.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let ${\mathcal X}$ and ${\mathcal Y}$ be metric spaces.
A continous bijection $f\:{\mathcal X}\to {\mathcal Y}$ 
is called a \emph{homeomorphism}\index{homeomorphism} 
if its inverse $f^{-1}\:{\mathcal Y}\z\to {\mathcal X}$ is also continuous.

If there exists a homeomorphism $f\:{\mathcal X}\to {\mathcal Y}$,
we say that ${\mathcal X}$ is \emph{homeomorphic}\index{homeomorphic} to ${\mathcal Y}$,
or  $\mathcal X$ and ${\mathcal Y}$ are \emph{homeomorphic}.
\end{thm}

If a metric space $\mathcal X$ is homeomorphic to a known space, for example plane, sphere, disc, circle and so on,
we may also say that $\mathcal X$ is a \emph{topological} plane, sphere, disc, circle and so on.

\begin{thm}{Definition}
A subset $A$ of a metric space $\mathcal{X}$ is called \emph{closed}\index{closed set} if whenever a sequence $(x_n)$ of points from $A$ converges in $\mathcal{X}$, we have that $\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n \in A$.

A set $\Omega \subset \mathcal{X}$ is called \emph{open}\index{open set} if for any $z\in \Omega$, 
there is $\eps>0$ such that $B(z,\eps)\subset\Omega$.
\end{thm}

An open set $\Omega$ that contains a given point $p$ is called \emph{neighborhood of $p$}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $Q$ be a subset of a metric space $\mathcal{X}$.
Show that $A$ is closed if and only if its complement $\Omega=\mathcal{X}\backslash Q$ is open.
\end{thm}
