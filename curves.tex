\section{Simple curves}

In the following definition we use the notion of {}\emph{metric space} which is discussed in the preliminaries; see \ref{sec:metric-spcaes}.
The Euclidean plane and space are the main examples of metric spaces that one should keep in mind. 

Recall that a bijective continuous map $f\:X\to Y$ between subsets of some metric spaces is called a {}\emph{homeomorphism} if its inverse $f^{-1}\:Y\z\to X$ is continuous.  

\begin{thm}{Definition} 
A connected subset $\gamma$ in a metric space is called a \index{simple curve}\emph{simple curve} if it is {}\emph{locally} homeomorphic to a real interval.
\end{thm}

It turns out that any simple curve $\gamma$ can be \index{parametrization of curve}\emph{parametrized} by a real interval or a circle.
That is, there is a homeomorphism $G\to\gamma$ 
where $G$ is a real interval (open, closed or semi-open) or the circle
\[\SS^1=\set{(x,y)\in\RR^2}{x^2+y^2=1}.\]
We omit a proof of this statement; it is not hard, but would take us away from the subject.
We hope however that this statement is intuitively obvious. % a formal proof can be found in???.

If $G$ is an open interval or a circle we say that $\gamma$ is a \index{endpoints}\emph{curve without endpoints}, otherwise it is 
called a {}\emph{curve with endpoints}.
In the case when $G$ is a circle we say that the curve is {closed curve}\emph{closed}. 
When $G$ is a closed interval, $\gamma$ is called an \index{arc}\emph{arc}.


A parametrization describes a curve completely.
We will denote a curve and its parametrization by the same letter;
for example, we may say a plane curve $\gamma$ is given with a parametrization $\gamma\:(a,b)\z\to \RR^2$.
Note, however, that any simple curve admits many different parametrization. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:9}
Find a continuous injective map $\gamma\:(0,1)\to\RR^2$ such that its image is not a simple curve.
\end{thm}


\section{Parametrized curves}

A \index{parameterized curve}\emph{parameterized curve} is defined as a continuous map $\gamma$ from a circle or a real interval (open, closed or semi-open) to a metric space. 
For a parameterized curve we do not assume that $\gamma$ is injective; in other words a parameterized curve might have \index{self-intersections}\emph{self-intersections}.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{17 mm}

\includegraphics{mppics/pic-130}
\end{wrapfigure}

If we say \index{curve}\emph{curve} it means we do not want to specify whether it is a parameterized curve or a simple curve.

If the domain of a parameterized curve is the closed unit interval $[0,1]$, then it is also called a \index{path}\emph{path}.
If in addition $p=\gamma(0)=\gamma(1)$, then $\gamma$ is called a \index{loop}\emph{loop};
in this case the point $p$ is called the \index{base of loop}\emph{base} of the loop.

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{aex:simple-curve}
Let $X$ be a subset of the plane.
Suppose that two distinct points $p,q\in X$ can be connected by a path in $X$.
Show that there is a simple arc in~$X$ connecting $p$ to $q$.
\end{thm}

\section{Smooth curves}

Curves in Euclidean space or plane are called \index{space curve}\emph{space} or \index{plane curve}\emph{plane curves}, respectively.

A parameterized space curve can be described by its coordinate functions 
\[\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t),z(t)).\]
Plane curves can be considered as a partial case of space curves with $z(t)\equiv 0$.

Recall that a real-to-real function is called \index{smooth function}\emph{smooth} if its derivatives of all orders are defined everywhere in the domain of definition.  
If each of the coordinate functions $x(t), y(t)$ and $z(t)$ of a space curve $\gamma$ are smooth, then the parametrized curve is called \index{smooth curve}\emph{smooth}.

If the \index{velocity vector}\emph{velocity vector} 
\[\gamma'(t)=(x'(t),y'(t),z'(t))\] 
does not vanish at any point, then the parameterized curve $\gamma$ is called \index{regular curve}\emph{regular}.

A simple space curve is called \index{smooth curve}\emph{smooth} (resp. \index{regular curve}\emph{regular}) if it admits a smooth (resp. regular) parametrization.
Regular smooth curves are among the main objects in differential geometry;
colloquially, the term \index{smooth curve}\emph{smooth curve} is often used as a shortcut for {}\emph{smooth regular curve}. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:L-shape}
Let 
\[f(t)=
\begin{cases}
0&\text{if}\ t\le 0,
\\
\frac{t}{e^{1\!/\!t}}&\text{if}\ t> 0.
\end{cases}
\]
Show that $\alpha(t)=(f(t),f(-t))$ gives a smooth parametrization of a simple curve formed by the union of two half-axis in the plane.

Show that any smooth parametrization of this curve has vanishing velocity vector at the origin.
Conclude that this curve is not regular and smooth;
that is, it does not admit a regular smooth parametrization.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:cycloid}
Describe the set of real numbers $\ell $
such that the plane curve $\gamma_\ell (t)= (t+\ell \cdot \sin t,\ell \cdot \cos t)$, $t\in\RR$ is

\begin{subthm}{ex:cycloid:regular}
regular;
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{ex:cycloid:simple}
simple.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

\section{Periodic parametrization}
A natural way to describe a closed simple curve is as a \index{periodic parameterization}\emph{periodic} parameterized curve $\gamma\: \RR\to \mathcal{X}$; that is, a curve such that $\gamma(t+\ell)=\gamma(t)$ for a fixed period $\ell > 0$ and all $t$.
For example, the unit circle in the plane can be described by the $2{\cdot}\pi$-periodic parametrization $\gamma(t)=(\cos t,\sin t)$.

{

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{17 mm}
\vskip-3mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-51}
\end{wrapfigure}

Any smooth regular closed curve can be described by a smooth regular loop.
But in general the closed curve described by a smooth regular loop might fail to be regular at its base; an example is shown on the diagram.

}

\section{Implicitly defined curves}

Suppose $f\:\RR^2\to \RR$ is a smooth function; 
that is, all its partial derivatives are defined in its domain of definition.
Let $\gamma\subset \RR^2$ be the set of solutions of the equation $f(x,y)=0$.

Assume $\gamma$ is connected.
According to the implicit function theorem (\ref{thm:imlicit}), the set $\gamma$ is a smooth regular simple curve if $0$ is a \index{regular value}\emph{regular value} of $f$.
This condition is equivalent to the gradient $\nabla f$ not vanishing at any point $p\in \gamma$.
In other words, if $f(p)=0$, then   
$f_x(p)\ne 0$ or $f_y(p)\ne 0$.%
\footnote{Here $f_x$ is a shortcut notation for the partial derivative
$\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}$.}

Similarly, assume $f,h$ is a pair of smooth functions defined in $\RR^3$.
The system of equations
\[\begin{cases}
   f(x,y,z)=0,
   \\
   h(x,y,z)=0.
  \end{cases}
\]
defines a regular smooth space curve if the set of solutions is connected and $0$ is a regular value of the map $F\:\RR^3\to\RR^2$ defined as
\[F\:(x,y,z)\mapsto (f(x,y,z),h(x,y,z)).\]
In this case it means that the gradients $\nabla f$ and $\nabla h$ are linearly independent at any point $p\in \gamma$.
In other words, the Jacobian matrix
\[
\Jac_pF=\begin{pmatrix}
f_x&f_y&f_z\\
h_x&h_y&h_z
\end{pmatrix}
\]
for the map $F\:\RR^3\to\RR^2$ has rank 2 at any point $p$ such that $f(p)\z=h(p)\z=0$.

The way described above to define a curve is called \index{implicitly defined curve}\emph{implicit};
if a curve is defined by its parametrization, we say that it is \index{explicitly defined curve}\emph{explicitly defined}.
While implicit function theorem guarantees the existence of regular smooth parametrizations,
when it comes to calculations, it is usualy easier to work directly with implicit representations. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:y^2=x^3}
Consider the set in the plane described by the equation
\[y^2=x^3.\]
Is it a simple curve?
Is it a smooth regular curve?
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:viviani}
Describe the set of real numbers $\ell$
such that the system of equations
\[\begin{cases}
x^2+y^2+z^2&=1
\\
x^2+\ell\cdot x+y^2&=0
\end{cases}\]
describes a smooth regular curve.
\end{thm}

\section{Proper curves}

A parametrized curve $\gamma$ in a metric space $\mathcal{X}$ is called \index{proper curve}\emph{proper} if for any compact set $K \subset X$, the inverse image $\gamma^{-1}(K)$ is compact.

For example, the curve $\gamma(t)=(e^t,0,0)$ defined on whole real line is not proper.
Indeed, the half-line $(-\infty,0]$ is not compact and it is the inverse image of unit closed ball around the origin.  

Note that closed curves ans arcs are automatically proper since the parameter set is compact.

A simple curve is called proper if it admits a proper parametrization.
It turns out that a simple curve is proper if and only if its image is a closed set.
In particular, any implicitly defined plane or space curve is proper.
We omit the proof of this statement, but it is not hard. %??? ref

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:proper-curve}
Use the Jordan's theorem (\ref{thm:jordan}) to show that any proper plane curve divides the plane in two connected components.  
\end{thm}
