\chapter{Supporting circlines}

\section{Definitions}

Suppose $\alpha\:[a,b]\to\RR^2$ is a smooth unit-speed plane curve and $t_0\z\in(a,b)$.

A circline $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ if $\alpha(t_0)\in\gamma$
and $\gamma$ lies locally on one side of $\alpha$.
If $p=\gamma(t_0)$ for a single value $t_0$,
then we can also say \emph{$\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $p$} without ambiguity.

More precisely, assume that there is a round neighborhood $U\ni p$ such that for some interval $[a',b']\ni t_0$
the arc $\bar\alpha\z=\alpha|_{[a',b']}$ has no self-intersection and runs in $U$ from its boundary to its boundary.
In this case $\alpha$ divides $U$ into sets  $L$ and $R$;
$L$ lies on the left and $R$ lies on the right from~$\bar\alpha$.
If $\gamma\cap U$ contains only points of $\bar\alpha$ and $R$, we say that \emph{$\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ on the right};
if $\gamma\cap U$ contains only points of $\bar\alpha$ and $L$, we say that \emph{$\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ on the left}.



Note that a circle supports itself on the right and left at the same time.

Suppose a unit-speed circline $\gamma$ supports a smooth unit-speed plane curve $\alpha$ at $t_0$.
Without loss of generality we can assume that $\gamma(0)\z=\alpha(t_0)$. 
Then $\gamma'(0)=\pm\alpha'(t_0)$.
If not, then the curve $\alpha$ would cross $\gamma$ transversely and therefore could not stay on the same side for values close to $t_0$.
Therefore reverting the parametrization of $\gamma$ if necessary we may (and further will) assume that 
\[\gamma'(0)=\alpha'(t_0)\]
holds for any supporting circline $\gamma$ to $\alpha$ at $t_0$.

\section{Supporting test}

The following proposition resembles the second derivative test. 

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:supporting-circline}
Assume $\gamma$ is a circle that that supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from the rigth (correspondingly left).  
Then 
\[\kappa(t_0)\ge \kappa
\quad(\text{correspondingly}\quad\kappa(t_0)\le \kappa).
\] 
where $\kappa$ is the signed curvature of $\gamma$ 
and $\kappa(t_0)$ is the signed curvature of $\alpha$ at $t_0$.

A partial converse also holds.
Namely, suppose a unit-speed circline $\gamma$ with signed curvature $\kappa$ starts at $\alpha(t_0)$ in the direction $\alpha'(t_0)$.
Then $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from the right (correspondingly left) if 
\[\kappa(t_0)> \kappa
\quad(\text{correspondingly}\quad\kappa(t_0)< \kappa).
\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
We prove only the case $\kappa>0$.
The 2 remaining cases $\kappa=0$ and $\kappa<0$ can be done essentially the same way.

Since $\kappa\ne0$, the curve $\gamma$ is a circle.
According to Proposition~\ref{prop:circline},
$\gamma$ has radius $\tfrac1\kappa$ and it is centered at 
\[z=\alpha(t_0)+\tfrac i\kappa\cdot \alpha'(t_0).\]
Consider the function 
\[f(t)=|z-\alpha(t)|^2-\tfrac1{\kappa^2}.\]

Note that $f(t)\le0$ (correspondingly $f(t)\ge0$) 
if an only if $\alpha(t)$ lies on the closed left (correspondingly right) side from $\gamma$.
It follows that 
\begin{itemize}
\item if $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from the right, 
then
\[f'(t_0)=0\quad\text{and}\quad f''(t_0)\le 0;\]

\item if $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from  the left, 
then 
\[f'(t_0)=0\quad\text{and}\quad f''(t_0)\ge 0;\]

\item if 
\[f'(t_0)=0\quad\text{and}\quad f''(t_0)< 0,\]
then $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from  the right;

\item if 
\[f'(t_0)=0\quad\text{and}\quad f''(t_0)> 0,\] then $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from  the left;
\end{itemize}

Direct calculations show that
\begin{align*}
f(t_0)&=0;
\\
f'(t_0)&=\left.\langle z-\alpha(t),z-\alpha(t) \rangle'\right|_{t=t_0}=
\\
&=-2\cdot \langle \alpha'(t_0),z-\alpha(t_0) \rangle=
\\&=-2\cdot \langle \alpha'(t_0),\tfrac i\kappa \cdot\alpha'(t_0) \rangle=
\\
&=0;
\\
f''(t_0)&=\langle z-\alpha(t),z-\alpha(t) \rangle''|_{t=t_0}=
\\
&=2\cdot\left( \langle \alpha'(t_0),\alpha'(t) \rangle-\langle \alpha''(t_0),z-\alpha(t) \rangle \right)=
\\
&=2\cdot\left(1-\kappa\cdot \frac1{\kappa(t_0)}\right)
\end{align*}
Hence the result.\qeds


\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Assume a closed smooth regular plane curve $\alpha$ runs between parallel lines on distance 1 from each other.
Show that there is a point on $\alpha$ with curvature at least $1$.
\end{thm}


\section{Lens lemma}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:lens}
Let $\alpha$ be a smooth regular simple curve that runs from $x$ to $y$.
Assume that $\alpha$ runs on the right side (correspondingly left side) of the oriented line $xy$ and only its end points $x$ and $y$ lie on the line.
Then $\alpha$ has a point with positive  (correspondingly negative) curvature.
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{35 mm}
\vskip-4mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-22}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

Note that the lemma fails for curves with self-intersections;
the curve $\alpha$ on the diagram always turns right, 
so it has negative curvature everywhere, but it lies on the right side of the line $xy$. 

\parit{Proof.}
Choose points $p$ and $q$ on $\ell$
so that the points $p, x, y, q$ appear in the same order on $\ell$.

Consider the smallest disc segment with chord $[pq]$ that contains $\alpha$.
Note that its arc $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at a point $s=\alpha(t_0)$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{50 mm}
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-23}
\bigskip
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-24}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

Note that the $\alpha'(t_0)$ is tangent to $\gamma$ at $s$.
Moreover $\alpha'(t_0)$ points in the direction of $q$;
that is, if we go along $\gamma$ in the direction  of $\alpha'(t_0)$ then we have to start at $p$ and end at $q$.
If the direction is opposite, then the arc of $\alpha$ from $s$ to $y$ would be trapped in the curvelinear triangle $xsp$ bounded by arcs of $\gamma$, $\alpha$ and the line segment $[px]$.
But this is impossible since $y$ does not belong to this triangle.



It follows that $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from the right.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:supporting-circline}, 
\[\kappa(t_0)\ge \kappa,\]
where $\kappa(t_0)$ is signed curvature of $\alpha$ at $t_0$ and $\kappa$ is the curvature of $\gamma$.
Evidently $\kappa>0$, hence the result.

\section{Convexity and inflection points}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Assume $\alpha$ is a closed regular simple plane curve with positive signed curvature.
Show that $\alpha$ bounds a convex set.%
\footnote{Hint: show that any tangent line to $\alpha$ is supporting.}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:convex+2pi}
Assume $\alpha$ is a closed smooth regular plane curve with positive signed curvature.
Show that $\alpha$ is simple if and only if its total curvature is $2\cdot\pi$. 
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:1-supporting} Assume a smooth regular curve $\alpha$ has curvature at most $1$ at any point (that is, $|\kappa_\alpha(t)|\le 1$ for any $t$).
Show that both unit circles tangent to $\gamma$ at $t_0$ are supporting.

Moreover, there is $\eps>0$ ($\eps=\tfrac12$ will do) such that any arc of $\alpha$ of length $<\eps$ starting at $p=\alpha(t_0)$ cannot enter the unit circle tangent to $\alpha$ at $p$.  
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Suppose $\alpha$ is a simple smooth regular curve in the plane with positive curvature.
Assume $\alpha$ crosses a line $\ell$ at the points $p_1,p_2,\dots p_n$ and these points appear on $\alpha$ in that same order.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Show that $p_2$ can not lie between $p_1$ and $p_3$ on $\ell$.

\item Show that if $p_3$ lies between $p_1$ and $p_2$ on $\ell$ then they appear on $\ell$ in the following order:  
\[p_1,p_3,\dots,p_4 ,p_2.\]

\item Try to describe all possible orders when $p_1$ lies between $p_2$ and $p_3$ (see the diagram).

\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

Recall that $\Conv X$ denotes the convex hull of the set $X$;
that is, $\Conv X$ is the intersection of all convex sets containing $X$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:convex-hull}
Suppose $\alpha$ is a simple smooth regular curve with positive curvature in the plane.
Then the boundary of $\Conv \alpha$ is formed by an arc of $\alpha$ together with a line segmet connecting the ends of this arc.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Suppose $\alpha$ is a simple smooth regular curve in the plane.
Show that $\alpha$ lies on one side from one of its tangent lines. 
\end{thm}

If the curvature of a curve $\alpha$ vanishes at $t_0$, then we say that $t_0$ is inflection value of the parameter, and $p=\alpha(t_0)$ is an inflection point;
the later convention might be ambiguous only if $\alpha$ has a self-intersection at $p$. 
In other words, $t_0$ is an inflection value if the osculating circline at $t_0$ coincides with the tangent line. 

\begin{figure}[h!]%{r}{30 mm}

\end{figure}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $\alpha\:\RR\to\RR^2$ be a smooth simple regular plane curve.
Assume $\alpha$ is periodic in the following sense:
there is $T>0$ and a vector $v\in\RR^2$ such that 
\[\alpha(t+T)=\alpha(t)+v.\]
Show that $\alpha$ has at least 2 inflection points in the interval $[0,T]$.

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem} 
Let $\alpha$ be a closed simple smooth regular plane curve.
Assume $\alpha$ has exactly two inflection points dividing $\alpha$ in two arcs $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$.
Then 
\[\Conv \alpha_1\supset \alpha_2
\quad\text{or}\quad
\Conv \alpha_2\supset \alpha_1.\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let us denote the inflection points by $v$ and $w$
and orient the arcs $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ from $v$ to $w$; we can then assume that both arcs $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ have positive curvature.

Set $F=\Conv \alpha_1$.
By Exercise~\ref{ex:convex-hull}, $F$ is bounded by an arc $\bar\alpha_1$ of $\alpha_1$ from $x$ to $y$ 
and the line segment $xy$.
We may assume that the line $xy$ is horizontal, $x$ lies on the left from $y$ and so $\alpha_1$ lies below the line.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-31}
\vskip0mm
\end{figure}

If $F\not\supset \alpha_2$, then $\alpha_2$ runs outside of $F$, so it has to cross the line segment $xy$.
Denote by $p_1, p_2,\dots$ the points of intersection of $\alpha_2$ with the line $xy$ as they appear on $\alpha_2$.

Since $\alpha_2$ has positive curvature, $p_1$ lies on left from $p_0$.
If $p_2$ lies between $x$ and $p_1$ then the curve $\alpha_2$ is trapped in the region bounded by the arc $xvp_2$ of $\alpha$ and the line segment $p_2x$;
therefore it can not reach $w$ --- a contradiction.
Therefore $p_2$ lies on the extension of $yx$ behind $x$.

Further $p_3$ lies on right from $p_2$. 
If $p_3$ lies between $p_1$ and $x$, then $\alpha_2$ is trapped in the region bounded by the arc $xvp_3$ of $\alpha$ and the line segment $p_3x$ --- a contradiction again.
Therefore $p_3$ lies on the extension of $xy$ behind $y$ and the arc $p_2p3$ of $\alpha$ surrounds $F$.
Whence
\[\Conv \alpha_2\supset \alpha_1.\]

\section{Four-vertex theorem}

A vertex of a smooth regular curve is defined as a critical point of its curvature;
in particular, any local minimum (or maximum) of the curvature is a vertex.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:vert-support}
Assume the osculating circle of a curve $\alpha$ at $t_0$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$.
Show that $t_0$ is a vertex of $\alpha$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Four-vertex theorem}\label{thm:4-vert}
Any smooth regular simple plane curve has at least four
vertices.
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{20 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-26}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

Evidently any closed curve has at least two vertexes --- where the minimum and the maximum of the curvature are attained.
On the diagram the vertexes are marked;
the first curve has one self-intersection and exactly two vertexes;
he second curve has exactly four vertexes and no self-intersections.

The four-vertex theorem was first proved by Syamadas Mukhopadhyaya \cite{mukhopadhyaya} for convex curves.
By now it has a large number of different proofs and generalizations.
We will present a proof given by Robert Osserman \cite{osserman}.

\parit{Proof.}
Fix a simple smooth regular closed plane curve $\alpha$.

Suppose that $2\cdot n$ points $p_1,s_1,\dots,p_n,s_n$ appear on a closed curve $\alpha$ in the same cyclic order.
Fix a real number $\kappa$.
Assume that the curvature of $\alpha$ at $p_i$ is at least $\kappa$ and its curvature at $s_i$ is at most $\kappa$.
Then each of $n$ arcs $p_{n}p_1$, $p_{1}p_2, \dots p_{n-1}p_n$ of
$\alpha$ has a point of minimum curvature in its interior.
Similarly each of the $n$ arcs $s_{n}s_1$, $s_{1}s_2, \dots s_{n-1}s_n$ of
$\alpha$ has a point of maximum curvature.

If one of these local minima coincides with a local maximum,
an arc around this point has constant curvature;
in this case all these points are vertexes and we have an infinite number of them.
If they are all different, then we have at least $2\cdot n$ vertexes.

Therefore it is sufficient to show that

\begin{clm}{}\label{clm-key}
there are at least 4 points $p_1,s_1,p_2,s_2$ with the described properties for some $\kappa$.
\end{clm}


Note that
\begin{clm}{}\label{clm:circumscribed circle}
$\alpha$
admits a unique \emph{circumscribed circle} $\gamma$; that is, a circle of minimal radius that encloses $\alpha$.
\end{clm}

Denote by $r$ the infimum of radii of circles that enclose $\alpha$.
We can choose a sequence of circles $\gamma_n$ enclosing $\alpha$ such that their radii $r_n\to r$.
Note that all the centers of $\gamma_i$ lie at a bounded distance from $\alpha$.
Therefore passing to a subsequence we can assume that the centers of $\gamma_n$ converge to a point $o$.
Note that the circle $\gamma$ with center $o$ and radius $r$ encloses $\alpha$;
hence the existence of the circumscribed circle follows.

If there are two distinct circumscribed circles, then $\alpha$ lies in the intersection of the discs bounded by these circles.
But this intersection is enclosed in a circle of smaller radius --- a contradiction.
Hence Claim \ref{clm:circumscribed circle} follows.


\begin{clm}{}
Assume $\gamma$ is the circumscribed circle of $\alpha$.
Then $\gamma$ touches $\alpha$ at least $2$ points which divide the $\gamma$ in arcs no longer than a semicircle.
\end{clm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{38 mm}
\vskip-4mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-271}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}


If it was not the case, then one could move $\gamma$ slightly keeping its radius the same so that $\gamma$ will not touch $\alpha$ at all.
But in this case $\alpha$ could be enclosed in a circle of smaller radius --- a contradiction.


Let us orient $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ counterclockwise.
Then at the common points the directions of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ coincide.
Note that these points appear on $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ in the same order;
otherwise $\alpha$ would not be simple.

Denote by $\kappa$ the signed curvature of $\gamma$, since it is oriented counterclockwise,
$\kappa\z=\tfrac1r>0$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{38 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-27}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}
  
Fix two common points $p_1$ and $p_2$ of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:supporting-circline}, the curvature of $\alpha$ at $p_1$ and $p_2$ is at least $\kappa$.
Let $\bar\alpha$ be the arc of $\alpha$ from $p_1$ to $p_2$.

We can assume that the circle is centered at the origin 
and the points $p_1$ and $p_2$ lie on the same vertical line in the right halfplane of the coordinate plane.

Let $o$ be the center of $\gamma$.
Consider another circle $\gamma'$ with the same radius $r$ and center $o'$ the leftmost point in the $x$-axis such that $\gamma^{\prime}$ intersects $\bar\alpha$.

Denote by $s_1$ a common point of $\bar\alpha$ and $\gamma'$;
we can assume that $s_1$ is not an end point of $\bar\alpha$.
At the point $s_1$ the directions of $\bar\alpha$ and $\gamma'$ coincide,
otherwise $\alpha$ could not be simple --- the same argument is used in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:lens}.
Therefore $\gamma'$ supports $\alpha$ from the left at $s_1$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:supporting-circline}, the curvature of $\alpha$ at $s_1$ is at most $\kappa$.

Repeating the same argument for another pair of points $p_2,p_3$,\footnote{If $p_1$ and $p_2$ divide $\gamma$ into two semicircles, then we can take $p_3=p_1$.} 
we prove Claim \ref{clm-key}.
Hence the theorem follows.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that any smooth regular curve of constant width has at least 6 vertexes.
\end{thm}

\section{Moon in a puddle}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:moon}
Let $F$ be a convex plane figure bounded by a simple closed smooth regular curve $\alpha$ of curvature bounded by 1.
Assume $\alpha$ is oriented counterclockwise, so the figure $F$ lies on the left from $\alpha$.
Show that there is a unit circle that is globally supporting $\alpha$ form the left at any given point.
\end{thm}

The following theorem was proved by Vladimir Ionin and German Pestov \cite{pestov-ionin}; we present their proof here.
It gives a first nontrivial example of the so called ``local to global theorems'' --- based on some local data (in this case the curvature of a curve) we can conclude a global property (in this case existence of a large disc surrounded by the curve).
For convex curves, the result was known much earlier \cite[\S 24]{blaschke}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:moon}
Assume $\alpha$ is a simple closed smooth regular plane curve of curvature bounded by 1.
Then it surrounds a unit disc.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Denote by $F$ the closed region surrounded by $\alpha$. 

\begin{figure}[h!]%{r}{38 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-32}
\vskip0mm
\end{figure}

Fix $p_1\in \alpha$.
Consider the disc $D_1$ of maximal radius 
that is tangent to $\alpha$ at $p_1$ and lies completely in $F$.

If the radius of $D_1$ is at least $1$, then the problem is solved.
Otherwise note that $p_1$ is an isolated point of the intersection $D_p\cap \alpha$.
Moreover according to Exercise~\ref{ex:1-supporting}, there is a fixed value $\eps>0$ such that any arc of $\alpha$
that starts at $p_1$ can not end in $D_1$.


Consider an arc $\alpha_1$ of $\alpha$ that runs along $\alpha$ from $p_1$ to the next point in $D_1$.
Denote by $F_1$ the region that contains $D_1$ and whose boundary is formed by $\alpha_1$ and part of the boundary of $D_1$.
From above $\length \alpha_1>\eps$.

Let $p_2$ be the midpoint of $\alpha_1$.
Let $D_2$ be the disc of maximal radius that is tangent to $\alpha_1$ at $p_2$ and lies completely in $F_1$. 
The disc $D_2$ touches the boundary $\partial F_1$ at other points, dividing it in at least two arcs.

Note that $D_2$ can not touch the boundary of $D_1$, otherwise it would lie inside $D_1$, which is impossible.
Therefore at least one of these arcs, say $\alpha_2$, do not contain the common boundary of $F_1$ and $D_1$.
Note that 
\[\length \alpha_2< \tfrac12\cdot\length\alpha_1.\]

Again, if the radius of $D_2$ is at least $1$, then the theorem is proved.
By Exercise~\ref{ex:1-supporting}, it happens if $\length \alpha_2<\eps$.
If the radius is less than 1, denote by $F_2$ the region that contains $D_2$ and is bounded by $\alpha_2$ and a part of the boundary of $D_2$. Clearly, we can repeat this construction as many times as needed. 

Since the length of the arc gets at least twice as small on each step, 
after several steps the obtained disc $D_n$ will lie completely in $F_{n-1}$ and therefore in $F$. 
\qeds

A straightforward modification of the above proof gives the following.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:moon+4-vert}
Suppose $\alpha$ is a closed simple smooth regular plane curve.
Denote by $F$ and $G$ the two closed domains bounded by $\alpha$, say $F$ is bounded and $G$ is unbounded.  
Then $\alpha$ has at least 2 osculating circlines that lie in $F$
and  2 osculating circlines that lie in $G$. 
\end{thm}

Note that Theorem~\ref{thm:moon} as well as the Four-vertex theorem \label{thm:4-vert} follow from Theorem~\ref{thm:moon+4-vert};
the first implication is evident and the second follows from Exercise~\ref{ex:vert-support}.


\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Suppose $\alpha$ is a closed simple smooth regular plane curve and $\gamma$ is a circle.
Assume $\alpha$ crosses $\gamma$ at the points $p_1,\dots,p_{2\cdot n}$ and these points appear in the same cycle order of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$.
Show that osculating circles at $n$ distinct points of $\gamma$ lie inside $\gamma$ and that osculating circles at other $n$ distinct points of $\gamma$ lie outside of $\gamma$.

Construct an example of a closed simple smooth regular plane curve $\alpha$ with only 4 vertexes that crosses a given circle at arbitrary many points.
