\section{Definitions}

Suppose $\alpha\:[a,b]\to\RR^2$ be a smooth unit-speed plane curve and $t_0\z\in(a,b)$.

A circline $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ if $\alpha(t_0)\in\gamma$
and $\gamma$ lies locally on one side of $\alpha$.
If $p=\gamma(t_0)$ for a single value $t_0$,
then we can also say \emph{$\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $p$} without ambiguity.

More precisely assume that there is a spherical neighborhood $U\ni p$ such that for some interval $[a',b']\ni t_0$
the arc $\bar\alpha=\alpha|_{[a',b']}$ has no self-intersection and runs from boundary to boundary of $U$.
In this case $\alpha$ divides $U$ into two sets  $L$ and $R$;
$L$ lies on the left and $R$ lies on the right from~$\bar\alpha$.
If $\gamma\cap U$ contains only points of $\bar\alpha$ and $R$, we say that \emph{$\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ on the right};
if $\gamma\cap U$ contains only points of $\bar\alpha$ and $L$, we say that \emph{$\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ on the left}.



Note that a circle supports itself on the right and left at the same time.

Suppose a unit-speed circline $\gamma$ supports a smooth unit-speed plane curve $\alpha$ at $t_0$.
Without loss of generality we can assume that $\gamma(0)\z=\alpha(t_0)$. 
Then $\gamma'(0)=\pm\alpha'(t_0)$.
If not, then the curve $\alpha$ would cross $\gamma$ transversely and therefore could not stay at the same side for values close to $t_0$.
Therefore reverting the parametrization of $\gamma$ if necessary we may (and further will) assume that 
\[\gamma'(0)=\alpha'(t_0)\]
holds for any supporting circline $\gamma$ to $\alpha$ at $t_0$.

\section{Supporting test}

The following proposition resembles the second derivative test. 

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:supporting-circline}
Assume $\gamma$ is a circle that that supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from rigth (correspondingly left).  
Then 
\[\kappa(t_0)\ge \kappa
\quad(\text{correspondingly}\quad\kappa(t_0)\le \kappa).
\] 
where $\kappa$ is the signed curvature of $\gamma$ 
and $\kappa(t_0)$ is the signed curvature of $\alpha$ at $t_0$.

A partial converse also holds.
Namely suppose a unit-speed circline $\gamma$ with signed curvature $\kappa$ starts at $\alpha(t_0)$ in the direction $\alpha'(t_0)$.
Then $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from the right (correspondingly left) if 
\[\kappa(t_0)> \kappa
\quad(\text{correspondingly}\quad\kappa(t_0)< \kappa).
\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
We prove only case $\kappa>0$.
The 2 remaining cases $\kappa=0$ and $\kappa<0$ can be done essentially same way.

Since $\kappa\ne0$, the curve $\gamma$ is a circle (it can not be a line).
According to Proposition~\ref{prop:circline},
$\gamma$ has radius $\tfrac1\kappa$ and it is centered at 
\[z=\alpha(t_0)+\tfrac i\kappa\cdot \alpha'(t_0).\]
Consider the function 
\[f(t)=|z-\alpha(t)|^2-\tfrac1{\kappa^2}.\]

Note that $f(t)\le0$ (correspondingly $f(t)\ge0$) 
if an only if $\alpha(t)$ lies on the closed left (correspondingly right) side from $\gamma$.
It follow that 
\begin{itemize}
\item if $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from right, 
then
\[f'(t_0)=0\quad\text{and}\quad f''(t_0)\le 0;\]

\item if $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from  left, 
then 
\[f'(t_0)=0\quad\text{and}\quad f''(t_0)\ge 0;\]

\item if 
\[f'(t_0)=0\quad\text{and}\quad f''(t_0)< 0,\]
then $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from  right;

\item if 
\[f'(t_0)=0\quad\text{and}\quad f''(t_0)> 0,\] then $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from  left;
\end{itemize}

Direct calculations show that
\begin{align*}
f(t_0)&=0;
\\
f'(t_0)&=\left.\langle z-\alpha(t),z-\alpha(t) \rangle'\right|_{t=t_0}=
\\
&=-2\cdot \langle \alpha'(t_0),z-\alpha(t_0) \rangle=
\\&=-2\cdot \langle \alpha'(t_0),\tfrac i\kappa \cdot\alpha'(t_0) \rangle=
\\
&=0;
\\
f''(t_0)&=\langle z-\alpha(t),z-\alpha(t) \rangle''|_{t=t_0}=
\\
&=2\cdot\left( \langle \alpha'(t_0),\alpha'(t) \rangle-\langle \alpha''(t_0),z-\alpha(t) \rangle \right)=
\\
&=2\cdot\left(1-\kappa\cdot \frac1{\kappa(t_0)}\right)
\end{align*}
Hence the result.\qeds


\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Assume $\alpha$ is a closed smooth unit-speed plane curve that runs in a unit disk.
Show that there is a point on $\alpha$ with curvature at least $1$.

Give two proofs, one based on DNA inequality \ref{thm:DNA} and the other based on Proposition~\ref{prop:supporting-circline}.
\end{thm}

\section{Lens lemma}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:lens}
Let $\alpha$ be a smooth regular simple curve that runs from $x$ to $y$.
Assume that $\alpha$ runs on right side (correspondingly left side) of the oriented line $xy$ and only its end points $x$ and $y$ lie on the line.
Then $\alpha$ has a point with positive  (correspondingly negative) curvature.
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{35 mm}
\vskip-4mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-22}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

Note that the lemma fails for curves with self-intersections;
the curve $\alpha$ on the diagram turns always right, 
so it has negative curvature everywhere and it lies on the right side of the line $xy$. 

\parit{Proof.}
Choose points $p$ and $q$ on $\ell$
so that the points $p, x, y, q$ appear in the same order on $\ell$.

Consider the smallest disc segment with chord $[pq]$ that contains $\alpha$.
Note that its arc $\gamma$ supports at a point $s=\alpha(t_0)$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{50 mm}
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-23}
\bigskip
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-24}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

Note that the $\alpha'(t_0)$ is tangent to $\gamma$ at $s$.
Moreover $\alpha'(t_0)$ points in the direction of $q$;
that is, if we go along $\gamma$ in the direction  of $\alpha'(t_0)$ then we have to start at $p$ and end at $q$.
If the direction is opposite, then the arc of $\alpha$ from $s$ to $y$ would be trapped in the curvelinear triangle $xsp$ bounded by arcs of $\gamma$, $\alpha$ and the line segment $[px]$.
But this is impossible since $y$ does not belong to this triangle.



It follows that $\gamma$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from right.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:supporting-circline}, 
\[\kappa(t_0)\ge \kappa,\]
where $\kappa(t_0)$ is signed curvature of $\alpha$ at $t_0$ and $\kappa$ is the curvature of $\gamma$.
Evidently $\kappa>0$, hence the result.

\section{Convexity and inflection points}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Assume $\alpha$ is a closed regular simple plane curve with positive signed curvature.
Show that $\alpha$ bounds a convex set.%
\footnote{Hint: show that any tangent line to $\alpha$ is supporting.}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:convex+2pi}
Assume $\alpha$ is a closed smooth regular plane curve with positive signed curvature.
Show that it $\alpha$ is simple if and only if its total curvature is $2\cdot\pi$. 
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:1-supporting} Assume a smooth regular curve $\alpha$ has curvature at most $1$ at any point (that is, $|\kappa_\alpha(t)|\le 1$ for any $t$).
Show that each of two unit circles tangent to $\gamma$ at $t_0$ is supporting.

Moreover there is $\eps>0$ ($\eps=\tfrac12$ will do) such that any arc of length $<\eps$ of the curve $\alpha$ that starts at $p=\alpha(t_0)$ can not enter the unit circle tangent to $\alpha$ at $p$.  
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Suppose $\alpha$ is a simple smooth regular curve in the plane with positive curvature.
Assume $\alpha$ crosses a line $\ell$ at the points $p_1,p_2,\dots p_n$ and these points appear on $\alpha$ in the same order.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Show that $p_2$ can not lie between $p_1$ and $p_3$ on $\ell$.

\item Show that if $p_3$ lies between $p_1$ and $p_2$ on $\ell$ then these points uppear on $\ell$ in the following order:  
\[p_1,p_3,\dots,p_4 ,p_2.\]

\item Try to describe all possible orders in the case if $p_1$ lies between $p_2$ and $p_3$ (see the diagram).

\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

Recall that $\Conv X$ denotes the convex hull of set $X$;
that is, $\Conv X$ is the intersection of all convex sets containing $X$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:convex-hull}
Suppose $\alpha$ is a simple smooth regular curve in the plane with positive curvature.
Then the boundary of $\Conv \alpha$ is formed by an arc of $\alpha$ and a line segmet connecting the ends of its arc.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Suppose $\alpha$ is a simple smooth regular curve in the plane.
Show that $\alpha$ lies on one side from one of its tangent lines. 
\end{thm}

If curvature of a curve $\alpha$ vanish at $t_0$, then we say that $t_0$ is inflection value of parameter, and $p=\alpha(t_0)$ is its inflection point;
the later convention might be ambiguous only if $\alpha$ has self-intersection at $p$. 
In other words, $t_0$ is inflection value if osculating circline at at $t_0$ coincides with the tangent line.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $\alpha\:\RR\to\RR^2$ be a smooth simple regular plane curve.
Assume $\alpha$ is periodic in the following sense:
there is $T>0$ and a vector $v\in\RR^2$ such that 
\[\alpha(t+T)=\alpha(t)+v.\]
Show that $\alpha$ has at least 2 inflection points in the interval $[0,T]$.

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem} 
Let $\alpha$ be a closed simple smooth regular plane curve.
Assume $\alpha$ has exactly two inflection points which divide $\alpha$ in two arcs $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$.
Then 
\[\Conv \alpha_1\supset \alpha_2
\quad\text{or}\quad
\Conv \alpha_2\supset \alpha_1.\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let us denote the inflection points by $v$ and $w$
and orient the arcs $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ from $v$ to $w$; we can assume that both arcs $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ have positive curvature.

Set $F=\Conv \alpha_1$.
By Exercise~\ref{ex:convex-hull}, $F$ is bounded by an arc $\bar\alpha_1$ of $\alpha_1$ from $x$ to $y$ 
and the line segment $xy$.
We may assume that the line $xy$ is horizontal, $x$ lies on the left from $y$ and so $\alpha_1$ lies below the line.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-31}
\vskip0mm
\end{figure}

If $F\not\supset \alpha_2$, then $\alpha_2$ runs outside of $F$, so it has to cross the line segment $xy$.
Denote by $p_1, p_2,\dots$ the points of intersection of $\alpha_2$ with the line $xy$ as they appear on $\alpha_2$.

Since $\alpha_2$ has positive curvature, $p_1$ lies on left from $p_0$.
If $p_2$ lies between $x$ and $p_1$ then the curve $\alpha_2$ is trapped in the region bounded by the arc $xvp_2$ of $\alpha$ and the line segment $p_2x$;
therefore it can not reach $w$ --- a contradiction.
Therefore $p_2$ lies on the extension of $yx$ behind $x$.

Further $p_3$ lies on right from $p_2$. 
If $p_3$ lies between $p_1$ and $x$, then $\alpha_2$ is trapped in the region bounded by the arc $xvp_3$ of $\alpha$ and the line segment $p_3x$ --- a contradiction again.
Therefore $p_3$ lies on the extension of $xy$ behind $y$ and the arc $p_2p3$ of $\alpha$ surrounds $F$.
Whence
\[\Conv \alpha_2\supset \alpha_1.\]

\section{Four-vertex theorem}

A vertex of a smooth regular curve is defined as a critical point of its curvature;
in particular, any point of local minimum (or maximum) is a vertex.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:vert-support}
Assume an osculating circle of curve $\alpha$ at $t_0$ supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$.
Show that $t_0$ is a vertex of $\alpha$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Four-vertex theorem}\label{thm:4-vert}
Any smooth regular simple plane curve has at least four
vertices.
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{20 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-26}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

Evidently any closed curve have to have at least two vertexes --- one minimum and one maximum.
On the diagram the vertexes are marked;
the first curve has one self-intersection and exactly two vertexes;
he second curve has exactly four vertexes and no self-intersections.

The four-vertex theorem was first proved by Syamadas Mukhopadhyaya \cite{mukhopadhyaya} for convex curves.
By now it has number of different proofs and generalizations.
We will present a proof given by Robert Osserman \cite{osserman}.

\parit{Proof.}
Fix a simple smooth regular closed plane curve $\alpha$.

Suppose that $2\cdot n$ points $p_1,s_1,\dots,p_n,s_n$ appear on a closed curve $\alpha$ in the same cyclic order.
Fix a real number $\kappa$.
Assume that the curvature of $\alpha$ at $p_i$ is at least $\kappa$ and its curvature at $s_i$ is at most $\kappa$.
Then each of $n$ arcs $p_{n}p_1$, $p_{1}p_2, \dots p_{n-1}p_n$ of
$\alpha$ has a minimum point of curvature in its interior.
Similarly each of $n$ arcs $s_{n}s_1$, $s_{1}s_2, \dots s_{n-1}s_n$ of
$\alpha$ has a maximum point of curvature.

In the case if some of these local minimum coincide with a local maximum,
an arc around this point has constant curvature;
in this case all these points are vertexes and we have infinite number of them.
If they all different, then we have least $2\cdot n$ vertexes.

Therefore it is sufficient to show that

\begin{clm}{}\label{clm-key}
there are at least 4 points $p_1,s_1,p_2,s_2$ with the described properties for some $\kappa$.
\end{clm}


Note that
\begin{clm}{}\label{clm:circumscribed circle}
$\alpha$
admits unique \emph{circumscribed circle} $\gamma$; that is, a circle of minimal radius that encloses $\alpha$.
\end{clm}

Denote by $r$ the least lower bound of circles that enclose $\alpha$.
We can choose a sequence of circles $\gamma_n$ enclosing $\alpha$ such that their radiuses $r_n\to r$.
Note that all the centers of $\gamma_i$ lie on bounded distance from $\alpha$.
Therefore passing to a subsequence we can assume that centers of $\gamma_n$ converge to a point $o$.
Note that the circle $\gamma$ with center $o$ and radius $r$ encloses $\alpha$;
hence the existence of circumscribed circle follows.

If there are two distinct circumscribed circle, then $\alpha$ lies in the intersection of the discs bounded by these circles.
But this intersection is enclosed in a circle of smaller radius --- a contradiction.
Hence Claim \ref{clm:circumscribed circle} follows.


\begin{clm}{}
Assume $\gamma$ is the circumscribed circle of $\alpha$.
Then $\gamma$ touches $\alpha$ at least $2$ points which divide the $\gamma$ in arcs no longer than semicircle.
\end{clm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{38 mm}
\vskip-4mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-271}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}


If it would not be the case then one could move $\gamma$ slightly keeping its radius the same so that $\gamma$ will not touch $\alpha$ at all.
But in this case $\alpha$ could be enclosed by a circle of smaller radius --- a contradiction.


Let us orient $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ counterclockwise.
Then at the common points the directions of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ coincide.
Note that these points appear on $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ in the same order;
otherwise $\alpha$ could not be simple.

Denote by $\kappa$ the signed curvature of $\gamma$, since it is oriented counterclockwise,
$\kappa\z=\tfrac1r>0$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{38 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-27}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}
  
Fix two common points $p_1$ and $p_2$ of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:supporting-circline}, the curvature of $\alpha$ at $p_1$ and $p_2$ is at least $\kappa$.
Let $\bar\alpha$ be the arc of $\alpha$ from $p_1$ to $p_2$.

We can assume that the circle is centered at the origin 
and the points $p_1$ and $p_2$ lie on the same vertical line in the right halfplane of the coordinate plane.

Let $o$ be the center of $\gamma$.
Consider an other circle $\gamma'$ with the same radius $r$ and the center $o'$ moved to the left along $x$-axis to the last moment it intersects $\bar\alpha$.

Denote by $s_1$ a common point of $\bar\alpha$ and $\gamma'$;
we can assume that $s_1$ is not an end point of $\bar\alpha$.
At the point $s_1$ the directions of $\bar\alpha$ and $\gamma'$ coinside,
otherwise $\alpha$ could not be simple --- the same argument is used in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:lens}.
Therefore $\gamma'$ supports $\alpha$ from left at $s_1$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:supporting-circline}, the curvature of $\alpha$ at $s_1$ is at most $\kappa$.

By repeating the same argument for an other pair of points $p_2,p_3$,\footnote{If $p_1$ and $p_2$ divide $\gamma$ into two semicircles, then we can take $p_3=p_1$.} 
we prove Claim \ref{clm-key}.
Whence the theorem follows.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Show that any smooth regular curve of constant width has at least 6 vertexes.
\end{thm}

\section{Moon in a puddle}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:moon}
Let $F$ be a convex plane figure bounded by a simple closed smooth regular curve $\alpha$ of curvature bounded by 1.
Assume $\alpha$ is oriented counterclockwise, so the figure $F$ lies on the left from $\alpha$.
Show there is a unit circle that is globally supporting $\alpha$ form the left at any given point.
\end{thm}

The following theorem was proved by Vladimir Ionin and Pestov German Pestov \cite{pestov-ionin}.
It gives a first nontrivial example of the so called ``local to global theorems'' --- based on some local data (in this case curvature of curve) we conclude its global property (in this case existence of large disc surrounded by the curve).
For convex curves, the result was known much earlier \cite[\S 24]{blaschke}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:moon}
Assume $\alpha$ is a simple closed smooth regular plane curve of curvature bounded by 1.
Then it surrounds a unit disc.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Denote by $F$ the closed region surrounded by $\alpha$. 

\begin{figure}[h!]%{r}{38 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-32}
\vskip0mm
\end{figure}

Fix $p_1\in \alpha$.
Consider the disc $D_1$ of maximal radius 
that is tangent to $\alpha$ at $p_1$ and lies completely in $F$.

If the radius of $D_1$ is at least $1$, then the problem is solved.
Otherwise note that $p_1$ is an isolated point of the intersection $D_p\cap \alpha$.
Moreover according to Exercise~\ref{ex:1-supporting}, there is a fixed value $\eps>0$ such that any arc of $\alpha$
that starts at $p_1$ can not end in $D_1$.

Consider an arc $\alpha_1$ of $\alpha$ that runs from $p_1$ to the first point in $D_1$.
Denote by $F_1$ the set bounded by $\alpha_1$ and a part of boundary of $D_1$ that containing $D_1$.
From above $\length \alpha_1>\eps$.

Let $p_2$ be the midpoint of $\alpha_1$.
Let $D_2$ be the disc of maximal radius that is tangent to $\alpha_1$ at $p_2$ and lies completely in $F_1$. 
The disc $D_2$ is touching the boundary $\partial F_1$ at other points, dividing it in at least two arcs.

Note that $D_2$ can not touch the boundary of $D_1$, otherwise it would lie in $D_1$ which is impossible.
Therefore at least one of these arcs, say $\alpha_2$, do not contain the common boundary $F_1$ and $D_1$.
Note that 
\[\length \alpha_2< \tfrac12\cdot\length\alpha_1.\]

Again, if the radius of $D_2$ is at least $1$, then the theorem is proved.
By Exercise~\ref{ex:1-supporting}, it happens if $\length \alpha_2<\eps$.
If the radius is smaller that 1, denote by $F_2$ be the set that is bounded by $\alpha_2$ and a part of boundary of $D_2$ and contains $D_2$ and repeat the construction several times. 

Since the length of arcs gets at least twice as small on each step, 
after several steps the obtained disc $D_n$ will lie completely in $F_{n-1}$ and therefore in $F$. 
\qeds

A straightforward modification of the proof above gives the following.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:moon+4-vert}
Suppose $\alpha$ is a closed simple smooth regular plane curve.
Denote by $F$ and $G$ the two closed domains bounded by $\alpha$, say $F$ is bounded and $G$ is unbounded.  
Then $\alpha$ has at least 2 osculating circlines that lie in $F$
and  2 osculating circlines that lie in $G$. 
\end{thm}

Note that Theorem~\ref{thm:moon} as well as the Four-vertex theorem \label{thm:4-vert} follow from Theorem~\ref{thm:moon+4-vert};
the first implication is evident and the second follow from Exercise~\ref{ex:vert-support}.
