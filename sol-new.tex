Suppose the complement $\Omega=\mathcal{X}\backslash Q$ is open.

It follows that $p$ is not a limit point of any sequence $q_n\in Q$.
That is, any limit of a sequence in $Q$ lies in $Q$;
that is, by the definition, $Q$ is closed.

Now suppose $\Omega=\mathcal{X}\backslash Q$ is not open.
Show that there is a point $p\in \Omega$ and a sequence $q_n\in Q$ such that such that $|p-q_n|_{\spc{X}}\z<\tfrac 1n$ for any $n$.

\parbf{\ref{aex:simple-curve}.}
Let $\alpha$ be a path connecting $p$ to $q$.

Passing to an arc of $\alpha$ if necessary,
we can assume that $\alpha(t)\ne p,q$ for $t\ne0,1$.

An open set $\Omega$ in $(0,1)$ will be called {}\emph{suitable}
if for any connected component $(a,b)$ of $\Omega$ we have $\alpha(a)=\alpha(b)$.
Show that the union of nested suitable sets is suitable.
Therefore we can find a maximal suitable set $\hat \Omega$.

Define $\beta(t)=\alpha(a)$ for any $t$ in a connected component $(a,b)\subset\hat \Omega$, and $\beta (t) = \alpha (t) $ for $t$ not in $\hat{\Omega}$.
Note that for any $x\in [0,1]$ the set $\beta^{-1}\{\beta(x)\}$ is connected.

It remains to reparametrize $\beta$ to make it injective.
In order to do that, we need to construct a non-decreasing surjective function $\tau\:[0,1]\z\to[0,1]$ such that 
$\tau(t_1)=\tau(t_2)$ if and only if there is a connected component $(a,b)\subset\hat \Omega$ such that $t_1,t_2\z\in [a,b]$.

The required function $\tau$ can be constructed in a similar way to the so-called \emph{devil's staircase} --- learn this construction and modify it.

The simple arc we are looking for is $\beta \circ \sigma$, where $\sigma:  [0,1]\to [0,1]$ is any right inverse of $\tau$.

%This problem involves reparametrization. Should we move it to the "reparametrizations section"?

\parbf{\ref{ex:L-shape}.}
Denote the union of two half-axis by $L$.

Recall that the function $f$ is smooth; see Section~\ref{sec:analysis}.
Therefore $t\mapsto \alpha(t)=(f(t),f(-t))$ is smooth as well.

Observe that $f(t)\to\infty$ as $t\to \infty$.
Since $f(0)=0$, the intermediate value theorem implies that $f(t)$ takes all nonnegative values for $t\ge 0$.
Use it to show that $L$ is the range of~$\alpha$.

\begin{wrapfigure}[12]{r}{24 mm}

\end{wrapfigure}

Further, show that the function $f$ is strictly increasing for $t> 0$.
Use this to show that the map $t\mapsto \alpha(t)$ is injective.

Summarizing, we get that $\alpha$ is a smooth parametrization of $L$. 

Now suppose $\beta\:t\mapsto (x(t),y(t))$ is a smooth parameterization of~$L$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that $x(0)=y(0)=0$.
Note that $x(t)\ge 0$ for any $t$ therefore $x'(0)=0$.
The same way we get that $y'(0)=0$.
That is, $\beta'(0)=0$;
so $L$ does not admit a smooth regular parameterization.

Show that 
\begin{itemize}
\item if $|\ell|<1$, then the set has two connected components with $z>0$ and $z<0$.
\item if $|\ell|\ge1$, then the set is connected.

Note that the linear independence of the gradients provides only a sufficient condition.
Therefore he case $\ell=\pm1$ has to be checked by hand.
In this case a neighborhood of $(\pm1,0,0)$ does not admit a smooth regular parametrization --- try to prove it. 
The case $\ell=1$ is shown on the diagram.

\parit{Remark.}
The case $\ell=\pm1$ is called \index{Viviani's curve}\emph{Viviani's curve}.

for $i>0$.
Show that $(\tau_i)$ is a partition of $[0,1]$;
that is, $0=\tau_0<\tau_1<\dots<\tau_n=1$.

By construction 
\begin{align*}
|\alpha(t_0)&-\alpha(t_1)|+|\alpha(t_1)-\alpha(t_2)|+\dots+|\alpha(t_{n-1})-\alpha(t_n)|=
\\
&=

Since the partition $(t_i)$ is arbitrary, we get 
\[\length \beta\ge \length \alpha.\]

Note that the partition $(\tau_i)$ is not arbitrary, therefore the inequality might be strict; it might happen if $\beta$ runs back and forth along $\alpha$.

Show that 
\[\length\gamma_k=k\cdot\length \gamma.\]

Now suppose the arc $\gamma$ of the Koch snowflake shown on the diagram is rectifiable; denote its length by $\ell$.
Observe that $\gamma$ can be divided into 4 arcs such that each one is a scaled copy of $\gamma$ with factor $\tfrac13$.
It follows that $\ell=\tfrac43\cdot\ell$.
Evidently $\ell>0$ --- a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{ex:arc-length-helix}.} 
We have to assume that $a\ne 0$ or $b\ne0$;
otherwise we get a constant curve.

Show that the curve has constant velocity $|\gamma'(t)|\equiv \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.

It remains to substitute $s\cdot \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ for $t$.

Choose a closed polygonal line $p_1\dots p_n$ inscribed in $\beta$.
By \ref{cor:convex=>rectifiable}, we can assume that its length is arbitrary close to the length of $\beta$;
that is, given $\eps>0$ 
\[\length (p_1\dots p_n)>\length\beta-\eps.\]

Show that we may assume in addition that each point $p_i$ lies on $\alpha$.

Observe that since $\alpha$ is simple, the points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ appear on $\alpha$ in the same cyclic order;
that is, the polygonal line $p_1\dots p_n$ is also inscribed in $\alpha$.
In particular 
\[\length\alpha\ge \length (p_1\dots p_n).\]
It follows that 
\[\length\alpha>\length\beta-\eps.\]
for any $\eps>0$.
Whence 
\[\length\alpha\ge\length\beta.\]

If $\alpha$ has self-intersections, then the points $p_1,\dots, p_n$ might appear on $\alpha$ in a different order, say $p_{i_1},\dots,p_{i_n}$.
Apply the triangle inequality to show that 
\[\length(p_{i_1}\dots p_{i_n})\ge \length (p_1\dots p_n)\]
and use it to modify the proof above.

\parbf{\ref{ex:convex-croftons}.} 
Denote by $\ell_{\vec u}$ the line segment 
obtained orthogonal projection of $\gamma$ to the line in the direction ${\vec u}$.
Since $\gamma_{\vec u}$ runs along $\ell_{\vec u}$ back and forth, we get 
\[\length\gamma_{\vec u}\ge 2\cdot\length\ell_{\vec u}.\]
Applying the Crofton formula, we get that 
\[\length\gamma\ge \pi\cdot \overline{\length\ell_{\vec u}}.\]

In the case of equality, the curve $\gamma_{\vec u}$ runs exactly back and forth along $\ell_{\vec u}$ without additional zigzags for almost all (and therefore for all) ${\vec u}$.

Let $K$ be a closed set bounded by $\gamma$.
Observe that the last statement implies that every line may intersect $K$ only along a closed segment or a single point.
It follows that $K$ is convex.

\parbf{\ref{adex:more-croftons}.}
The proof is identical to the proof of the standard Crofton formula.
To find the coefficient it is sufficient to check it on a unit interval.
The latter can be done by integration:
\begin{align*}
\frac1{k_a}&=\frac{1}{\area \mathbb{S}^2}\cdot\iint_{\mathbb{S}^2} |x|;
&
\frac1{k_b}&=\frac{1}{\area \mathbb{S}^2}\cdot\iint_{\mathbb{S}^2} \sqrt{1-x^2}.

The answers are $k_a=2$ and $k_b=\tfrac4\pi$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:intrinsic-convex}.}
The ``only-if'' part is trivial.
To show the ``if'' part, assume $A$ is not convex;
that is, there are points $x,y\in A$ and a point $z\notin A$ that lies between $x$ and $y$.

Since $A$ is closed, its complement is open.
That is, the ball $B(z,\eps)$ does not intersect $A$ for some $\eps>0$.

Show that there is $\delta>0$ such that any path of length at most $|x-y|_{\RR^3}+\delta$ passes thru $B(z,\eps)$.
It follows that $|x-y|_A\ge |x-y|_{\RR^3}+\delta$, 
in particular $|x-y|_A\ne |x-y|_{\RR^3}$.

The spherical curve shown on the diagram does not have antipodal pairs of points.
However it has three points $x,y,z$ on one of its sides and their antipodal points $-x,-y,-z$ on the other.
Show that this property is sufficient to conclude that the curve does not lie in any hemisphere.

\parbf{\ref{ex:bisection-of-S2}.}
Assume contrary, then by the hemisphere lemma (\ref{lem:hemisphere}) $\gamma$ lies in an open hemisphere.
In particular it cannot divide $\mathbb{S}^2$ into two regions of equal area --- a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{ex:flaw}.}
The very first sentence is wrong --- it is {}\emph{not} sufficient to show that diameter is at most 2.
For example an equilateral triangle with circumradius slightly above $1$ may have diameter (which is defined as the maximal distance between its points) slightly bigger than $\sqrt3$, so it can be made smaller that $2$.

On the other hand, it is easy to modify the proof of the hemisphere lemma (\ref{lem:hemisphere}) to get a correct solution.
That is, (1) choose two points $p$ and $q$ on $\gamma$ that divide it into two arcs of the same length;
(2) set $z$ to be a midpoint of $p$ and $q$,
and (3) show that $\gamma$ lies in the unit disc centered at $z$.

Assume $\length \gamma<2\cdot\pi$.
By \ref{SHORT.adex:crofton:crofton},
\[\overline{\length \gamma_{\vec u}}<2\cdot\pi.\]
Therefore we can choose ${\vec u}$ so that 
\[\length \gamma_{\vec u}<2\cdot\pi.\]

Observe that $\gamma_{\vec u}$ runs in a semicircle $h$ and therefore $\gamma$ lies in a hemisphere with $h$ as a diameter.

Since $\gamma(0)=\gamma(\ell)$ and $\gamma'(0)=\gamma'(\ell)$, the right hand side vanishes.


Note that without loss of generality we can assume the curve in \ref{thm:DNA} is described by a loop $\gamma\:[0,\ell]\to\RR^3$ parametrized by arc-length.
We can also assume that the origin is the center of the ball; that is $|\gamma|\le 1$.
Since $\gamma$ is a smooth closed curve, we have

Show that $\tan_a(t)=\gamma'_a/|\gamma'_a|$ starts with the horizontal direction $\tan_a(0)=(1,0)$, turns monotonically to angle $\theta_a$, then monotonically to $-\theta_a$ and then monotonically to back to $\tan_a(2\cdot\pi)=(1,0)$.
It follows that if $|a|>1$, then
$\Psi(\gamma_a)=0$ and $\tc{\gamma_a}=4\cdot\theta_a$.

\parit{Case $a=-1$.}
The velocity $\gamma'_{-1}(t)$ vanishes at $t=0$ and $2\cdot\pi$.
Nevertheless, the curve admits a smooth regular parametrization --- find it.
In this case $\Psi(\gamma_{-1})=-\pi$ and $\tc{\gamma_{-1}}=\pi$.

\parit{Case $a=1$.}
The velocity $\gamma'_1(t)$ vanishes at $t=\pi$.
At $t=\pi$ the curve has a cusp;
that is, $\gamma_1$ turns exactly back at the time $\pi$.
So $\gamma_1(t)$ has undefined total signed curvature.
The curve is a joint of two smooth arcs with external angle $\pi$, and
the total curvature of each arc is $\tfrac\pi2$, so 
$\tc{\gamma_{1}}=\tfrac\pi2+\pi+\tfrac\pi2=2\cdot\pi$.

Show that

By regularity of $\gamma$, $\gamma'\ne0$.
So if $\gamma_\ell'(t)=0$, then $\ell\cdot \skur(t)= 1$.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:length':formula}.} Observe that we can assume that $\gamma$ is parametrized by its arc-length, so $\gamma'(t)=\tan(t)$.
Suppose $|\ell|<\frac{1}{\kur(t)}$ for any $t$.
Then 
\[
|\gamma_\ell'(t)|=(1-\ell\cdot\skur(t)).

Therefore

Increase the torsion of the dashed arc without changing the curvature until a self-intersection appears.

\parbf{\ref{ex:vertex-support}.}
Apply the spiral lemma (\ref{lem:spiral}).

\parit{Direct solution.} 
We will assume that the curvature does not vanish at $p$, the remaining case is simpler.
We may assume that $\gamma$ is a unit-speed curve and $p=\gamma(0)$.
Further, we may assume that be the center of curvature of $\gamma$ at $p$ is the origin;
in other words, $\kappa(0)\cdot\gamma(0)+ \norm(0)=0$.

Since the osculating circle supports $\gamma$ at $p$,
we get that the function $f\:t\mapsto \langle\gamma(t),\gamma(t)\rangle$ has a local minimum or maximum at $0$.

Direct calculations show that 
\begin{align*}
f'
&=\langle\gamma,\gamma\rangle'
=2\cdot\langle\tan,\gamma\rangle,
\\
f''
&=2\cdot\langle\tan,\gamma\rangle'
=2\cdot\langle\tan',\gamma\rangle+2\cdot\langle\tan,\tan\rangle
=2\cdot\kappa\cdot\langle\norm,\gamma\rangle+2,

f'''
&=2\cdot\kappa'\cdot\langle\norm,\gamma\rangle
+2\cdot\kappa\cdot\langle\norm',\gamma\rangle+\cancel{2\cdot\kappa\cdot\langle\norm,\tan\rangle}.
\end{align*}

Observe that $\norm'(0)\perp\gamma(0)$.
Therefore $f'(0)=0$, $f''(0)=0$, and $f'''(0)\z=-2\cdot\kappa'/\kappa$.
Since $f$ is a maximum or minimum at $0$, we get that $f'''(0)=0$ and therefore
$\kappa'=0$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:support}.} Consider the coordinate system with $p$ as the origin and $x$-axis as the common tangent line to $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$.
We may assume that $\gamma_i$ are defined in $(-\eps,\eps)$ for some small $\eps>0$,
so that they run almost horizontally to the right.

Given $t\in[0,1]$ consider the curve $\gamma_t$ that is tangent and cooriented to the $x$ axis at  $\gamma_t(0)$ and has signed curvature defined by $\skur_t(s)=(1\z-t)\cdot\skur_0(s)+t\cdot\skur_1(s)$.
It exists by \ref{thm:fund-curves-2D}.

Choose $s\approx 0$.
Consider the curve $\alpha_s\:t\mapsto \gamma_t(s)$.
Show that $\alpha_s$ moves almost vertically up.
Use the fact that $\gamma_t$ moves almost horizontally to the right to show that in a small neighborhood of $p$, the curve $\gamma_1$ lies above $\gamma_0$,
whence the statement follows.

In the latter case we have two choices, either $p_4$ lies between $p_2$ and $p_3$ and then further order is determined uniquely or $p_2$ lies between $p_3$ and $p_4$.

Denote the set of solutions by $\Phi_\ell$.

Show that $\nabla_p f=0$ if and only if $p=(0,0,0)$.
Use \ref{prop:implicit-surface} to conclude that if $\ell\ne 0$, then $\Phi_\ell$ is a union of disjoint smooth regular surfaces.

Show that $\Phi_\ell$ is connected if and only if $\ell\le 0$.
It follows that if $\ell<0$, then $\Phi_\ell$ is a smooth regular surface, and if $\ell>0$ --- it is not.

The case $\ell=0$ has to be done by hand --- it does not satisfy the sufficient condition in \ref{prop:implicit-surface}, but that does not solely imply that $\Phi_0$ is not a smooth surface.

Show that any neighborhood of origin in $\Phi_0$ cannot be described by a graph in any coordinate system;
so by the definition (Section~\ref{sec:def-smooth-surface}) $\Phi_0$ is not a smooth surface.

\parbf{\ref{ex:inversion-chart}.}

\left(\tfrac{2\cdot v}{1+u^2+v^2}\right)^2
+\left(\tfrac{2}{1+u^2+v^2}-1\right)^2=1.\]
for any $u$ and $v$.

Furthermore, show that the map $(x,y,z)\mapsto (\tfrac{2\cdot x}{x^2+y^2+z^2},\tfrac{2\cdot y}{x^2+y^2+z^2})$
describes the inverse of $s$, which is continuous away from the origin.
In particular, $s$ is an embedding that covers the entire sphere except for the origin.

It remains to show that $s$ is regular; that is, $s_u$ and $s_v$ are linearly independent at all points of the $(u,v)$-plane.

\parbf{\ref{ex:revolution}.}

Show that $s$ is regular; that is, $s_t$ and $s_\theta$ are linearly independent.
(It might help to observe that $s_t\perp s_\theta$).

Show that $s$ is a embedding; that is, any $(t_0,\theta_0)$ admits a neighborhood $U$ in the $(t,\theta)$-plane such that the restriction $s|_U$ has a continuous inverse.
It remains to apply \ref{cor:reg-parmeterization}.

\parbf{\ref{ex:star-shaped-disc}.} 
The solutions of these exercises are build on the following general construction known as the \index{Moser trick}\emph{Moser trick}.

Suppose that $\vec u_t$ is a smooth time-dependent vector field on a plane.
Consider the ordinary differential equation $x'(t)=\vec u_t(x(t))$.
Consider the map $\iota\:x(0)\mapsto x(1)$ where $t\mapsto x(t)$ is a solution of the equation.
The map $\iota$ is called the \index{flow}\emph{flow} of vector field $\vec u_t$ for the time interval $[0,1]$.
Observe that according to \ref{thm:ODE} the map $\iota$ is smooth in its domain of definition.
Moreover the same holds for its inverse $\iota^{-1}$;
indeed, $\iota^{-1}$ is the flow for of the vector field $-\vec u_{1-t}$.
That is, $\iota$ is a diffeomorphism from its domain of definition to its image. 


Therefore, in order to construct a diffeomorphism from one open subset of the plane to another it is sufficient to construct a smooth vector field such that its flow maps one set to the other;
such map is automatically a diffeomorphism.


\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:plane-n}.}
Suppose $\Sigma=\RR^2\backslash{p_1,\dots,p_n}$ and $\Theta=\RR^2\backslash{q_1,\dots,q_n}$.

$\gamma_i(1)=q_i$, and $\gamma_i(t)\ne \gamma_j(t)$ if $i\ne j$.

Choose a smooth vector field $\vec v_t$ such that $\vec v_t(\gamma_i(t))=\gamma'_i(t)$ for any $i$ and $t$.
We can assume in addition that $\vec v_t$ vanishes outside of a sufficiently large disc; this can be arranged by  multiplying the vector field by a function 
$\sigma_1(R-|x|)$; see page \pageref{page:sigma-function}.

It remains to apply the Moser trick to the constructed vector field.

Without loss of generality we can assume that the origin belongs to both $\Sigma$ and~$\Theta$.

In each case show that there is a vector field $\vec v$ defined on $\RR^2\backslash\{0\}$ that flows $\Sigma$ to $\Theta$.
In fact one can choose radial fields of that type,
but be careful with the cases \ref{SHORT.ex:star-shaped-disc:nonsmooth} and \ref{SHORT.ex:star-shaped-disc:star-shaped} --- they are not as easy as one might think.

Assume a neighborhood of $p$ in $\Sigma$ is a graph $z=f(x,y)$.
In this case $s\:(u,v)\z\mapsto (u,v,f(u,v))$ is a smooth chart at $p$.
Show that the plane spanned by $s_u$ and $s_v$ is not vertical;
together with \ref{def:tangent-plane}, this proves the if part.

For the only-if part, fix a chart

Denote by $\vec k$ the unit vector in the direction of the $z$ axis.

Conclude that $s_u\perp \vec k$ and $s_v\perp \vec k$ at

Suppose that the osculating paraboloid is described by the graph

Since $\Sigma$ is mirror symmetric, so is the paraboloid;
that is, changing $y$ to $(-y)$ does not change the value 
$\ell\cdot x^2+2\cdot m\cdot x\cdot y+n\cdot y^2$.
In other words $m=0$, or equivalently, the $x$-axis points in a direction of curvature.

Denote by $\Norm_1(s)$ and $\Norm_2(s)$ the unit normal vectors to $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ at $\gamma(s)$.
Since $\gamma$ is a curvature line in $\Sigma_1$,  
$\Norm_1'$ is proportional to $\gamma'$;
in particular $\langle\Norm_1',\Norm_2\rangle=0$.

By the assumption, $\langle \Norm_1(t),\Norm_2(t)\rangle$ is constant.
By taking its derivative and applying the above identity, show that $\langle\Norm_1,\Norm_2'\rangle=0$.
Conclude that $\Norm_2'$ is proportional to $\gamma'$

Since $\Sigma$ is closed, the norm of $\Shape$ is bounded.
Whence $f_t$ is regular for $t$ sufficiently close to $ 0$.

Observe that these two families are orthogonal to each other.
Therefore the Hessian matrix in the frame $s_u/|s_u|$ and $s_v/|s_v|$ will have zeros on the diagonal.

Suppose that a point $p$ lies in the intersection $\Pi\cap\Sigma$.

Show that if the tangent plane $\T_p\Sigma$ is parallel to $\Pi$,
then $p$ is an isolated point of the intersection $\Pi\cap\Sigma$.

It follows that if $\gamma$ is a connected component of the intersection $\Pi\cap\Sigma$ that is not an isolated point,
then $\Pi$ \index{transverse intersection}\emph{intersects $\Sigma$ tranversally} along $\gamma$;
that is, at each point $p$ on $\gamma$ the tangent plane $\T_p\Sigma$ is not parallel to $\Pi$.
Apply the implicit function theorem to show that $\gamma$ is a smooth regular curve.

Finally, observe that curvature of $\gamma$ cannot be smaller than normal curvature of $\Sigma$ in the same direction.
Whence $\gamma$ has no points with vanishing curvature, and therefore it has signed curvature of a definite sign.

The exercise can be reduced to the following deeper result: \emph{if Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is at least $1$,

We can pass to a subsequence such that either $f(x_n,y_n)$ converges to some finite value $z_\infty$ or it diverges to $-\infty$.

In the first case, show that the point $(x_\infty, y_\infty,z_\infty)$ does not lie on $\Sigma$, but it has arbitrary close points on $\Sigma$.
That is $\Sigma$ is not proper --- a contradiction.

If $f(x_n,y_n)\to -\infty$, use convexity of $f$ to show that $f(\tfrac{x_n}2 ,\tfrac{y_n}2)\z\to -\infty$.

We may assume that the origin of the plane leis in $\Omega$.
Show that in this case the boundary of $\Omega$ can be written in polar coordinates as $(\theta,f(\theta))$ where $f\:\mathbb{S}^1\to\RR$ is a positive continuous function.
Then homeomorphism to the plane can be described in polar coordinate by changing only the radial coordinate;

Denote by $\bar\gamma$ the projection of $\gamma$ to the $(x, y)$-plane.

Observe that this function cannot be constant, and arrive to a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{ex:crosss}.}
This problem follows easily from the so-called \index{Morse lemma}\emph{Morse lemma}.
The following sketch is a slightly stripped version of it.
A more conceptual proof can be built on the Moser's trick \cite{palais}.

\medskip

Choose a tangent-normal coordinates at $p$ so that the axis point in the principle directions of $\Sigma$ at $p$;
let $z=f(x,y)$ be the local graph representation of $\Sigma$.
We need to show that the solution of the equation $f(x,y)=0$ is a union of two smooth curves that intersect transversely at $p$.

Prove the following claim:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Suppose that  $x\mapsto h(x)$ is a smooth function defined in an open interval $\mathbb{I}\ni0$ such that $h(0)=h'(0)=0$ and $h''(0)>0$.
 Then, for a smaller interval $\mathbb{J}\ni0$ there is a unique smooth function $a\:\mathbb{J}\to\RR$ such that $h=a^2$, $a(0)=0$ and $a'(0)> 0$.
\end{itemize}
Note that by passing to a small rectangular domain $|x|,|y|<\eps$, we can assume that $f_{xx}>\eps$ and $f_{yy}<-\eps$. 
Show that if $\eps$ is small, then for every $x$ there is unique $y(x)$ such that $f_x(x,y(x))=0$; 
moreover the function $x\mapsto y(x)$ is smooth.

Set $h(x)=f(x,y(x))$.
Note that $h(0)=h'(0)=0$ and $h''>0$.
Applying the claim, we get a function $a$ such that $h=a^2$, where $a(0)=0$ and $a'(0)>0$.

Observe that $g(x,y)=h(x)-f(x,y)\ge 0$ and $g_y(x,y(x))\z=g(x,y(x))\z=0$ and $g_{yy}>0$.
Applying the claim for each functions $y\mapsto g(x,y)$ with fixed $x$, we get that $g(x,y)=b(x,y)^2$ for a smooth function $b$ such that 
$b(x,y(x))=0$ and $b_y(x,y(x))>0$.

It follows that 
\begin{align*}
f(x,y)&=a(x)^2-b(x,y)^2=
(a(x)-b(x,y))\cdot (a(x)+b(x,y)).
\end{align*}
That is $f(x,y)=0$ if $a(x)\pm b(x,y) =0$.

It remains to observe that the two functions $g_\pm(x,y)=a(x)\pm b(x,y)$ have distinct non-zero gradients at $0$.
Therefore each equation $a(x)\pm b(x,y) =0$ defines a smooth regular curve in a neighborhood of $p$;
see Section~\ref{sec:implicit-curves}.

Show that $s$ is a diffeomorphism from $F_\eps$ to a south hemisphere of~$\Sigma$.
It remains to observe that unit disc is diffeomorphic to the hemisphere.

\parbf{\ref{ex:saddle-graph}.}
Suppose that orthogonal projection of $\Sigma$ to the $(x,y)$-plane is not injective.
Show that there is a point $p\in\Sigma$ with vertical tangent plane;
that is, $\T_p\Sigma$ is perpendicular to the $(x,y)$-plane.

Let $\Gamma_p$ be the connected component of $p$ in the intersection of $\Sigma$ and the affine tangent plane $\T_p\Sigma$.
Use \ref{ex:crosss} to show that $\Gamma_p$ is a union of smooth regular curves that can cross each other transversely.
Moreover two of these curves pass thru $p$ and $\Gamma_p$ does not bound a compact region on $\Sigma$.

Show that $\Gamma_p$ must have at least 4 ways to escape to infinity.
On the other hand, since $\Sigma$ is a graph outside of compact set $K$, we have that $\Gamma_p\backslash K$ is a graph of a real-to-real function that has only two ways to escape to infinity --- a contradiction.

Note that by \ref{thm:convex-embedded}, $\Sigma$ bounds a strictly convex region.
Therefore we can assume that $\Norm(p)\ne\Norm(q)$, otherwise $p=q$ and the inequality is evident.

Further, we can assume that $\Norm(p)+\Norm(q)\ne 0$, otherwise the right hand side is undefined.


In the remaining case the tangent planes $\T_p$ and $\T_q$ intersect along a line, say $\ell$.
Set $\alpha=\tfrac12\cdot\measuredangle(\Norm(p),\Norm(q))$;
observe that $2\cdot\cos\alpha= |\Norm(p)+\Norm(q)|$.
Let $x\in \ell$ be the point that minimize the sum $|p-x|\z+|x-q|$.
Show that $\measuredangle\hinge xpq\ge \pi-2\cdot\alpha$.
Conclude that

\parbf{\ref{ex:hat-convex}.} Suppose that there is a minimizing geodesic $\gamma\not\subset\Delta$ that ends $p$ and $q$ lie in $\Delta$.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that only one arc of $\gamma$ lies outside of $\Delta$.
Reflection of this arc  with respect to $\Pi$ together with the remaining part of $\gamma$ forms another curve $\hat\gamma$ from $p$ to $q$;
it runs partly along $\Sigma$ 
and partly outside $\Sigma$,
but does not get inside $\Sigma$.
Note that
\[\length\hat\gamma=\length\gamma.\]


Denote by $\bar\gamma$ the closest point projection of $\hat\gamma$ on $\Sigma$.
Note that the curve $\bar\gamma$ lies in $\Sigma$, 
it has the same ends as $\gamma$,

\[\length\bar\gamma<\length\gamma.\]
This means that $\gamma$ is not length minimizing,

Calculate $\gamma''(t)$ and show that it is proportional to $\Norm(\gamma(t))$.
Note that the latter is equivalent to $\gamma''(t)\perp\T_{\gamma(t)}$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:asymptotic-geodesic}.} Without loss of generality, we can assume that $\gamma$ has unit speed.
By the definition of geodesic, we have that $\gamma''(s)\perp\T_{\gamma(s)}$. 
Therefore 
\[\gamma''(s)=k_n(s)\cdot\Norm(\gamma(s))},\]
where $k_n(s)$ is the normal curvature of $\gamma$ at time $s$.
Since $\gamma$ is asymptotic, $k_n(s)\equiv 0$;
that is, $\gamma''(s)\equiv 0$, therefore $\gamma'$ is constant and $\gamma$ runs along a line segment.

\parbf{\ref{ex:reflection-geodesic}.}
Denote by $\mu$ a unit vector perpendicular to $\Pi$.
Since $\gamma$ lies in $\Pi$, we have that $\gamma''$ is parallel to $\Pi$, or equivalently $\gamma''\perp \mu$.
Since $\gamma$ is unit speed, \ref{prop:a'-pertp-a''} implies that $\gamma''\perp\gamma'$.

Since $\Sigma$ is mirror symmetric with respect to  a plane $\Pi$,
the tangent palne $\T_{\gamma(t)}\Sigma$ is also mirror symmetric with respect to  a plane $\Pi$.
It follows that $\T_{\gamma(t)}\Sigma$ is spanned by $\mu$ and $\gamma'(t)$.
Therefore $\gamma''\perp \mu$ and $\gamma''\perp\gamma'$ imply $\gamma''\perp\T_{\gamma(t)}\Sigma$;
that is, $\gamma$ is a geodesic.

\parbf{\ref{ex:clairaut}.} 
We can assume that the origin lies on the axis of revolution and $\vec i$ points in the direction of the axis.
Use \ref{lem:constant-speed} to show that it is sufficient to prove that

is constant.

Since $\gamma''(t)\perp\T_{\gamma(t)}$ we have that three vectors $\vec i$, $\gamma$, and $\gamma''$ lie in the same plane.
In particular $\langle\gamma''\times \gamma,\vec i\rangle=0$.
Therefore
\begin{align*}

\langle\gamma'\times \gamma',\vec i\rangle+\langle\gamma''\times \gamma,\vec i\rangle =0.

By \ref{ex:reflection-geodesic}, any meridian of $\Sigma$ is a closed geodesic.
Consider an arbitrary closed geodesic $\gamma$.

Note that if $\gamma$ is tangent to a meridian at some point, then by uniqueness, $\gamma$ runs along the meridian; in particular it is non-contractible.

It remains to consider the case when $\gamma$ intersect meridians transitively.
So the longitude of $\gamma$ is monotonic.
Whence again $\gamma$ is non-contractible.

Denote by $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_1$ the arcs of

Suppose that $\alpha_1$ is distinct from $\beta_1$.

Note that $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_1$ are shorest paths with the same endpoints;
in particular they have the same length.
Exchanging $\alpha_1$ in $\alpha$ to $\beta_1$ produces a shortest path, say $\hat\alpha$, that is distinct from $\alpha$.
By \ref{prop:gamma''}, $\hat\alpha$ is a geodesic.

Suppose $\alpha_1$ is a proper subarc of $\alpha$;
that is, if $\alpha_1\ne\alpha$, or, equivalently, either $p$ or $q$ is not an endpoint of $\alpha$.
Then $\alpha$ and $\hat\alpha$ share one point and velocity vector at this point.
By \ref{prop:geod-existence} $\alpha$ coincides with $\hat\alpha$ --- a contradiction.

It follows that $p$ and $q$ are the end points of $\alpha$.
The same way we can show that $p$ and $q$ are the end points of $\beta$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:min-geod+plane}.}
Assume a shortest path $\alpha$ changes the sides of $\Pi$ at least twice.
In this case there is an arc $\alpha_1$ of $\alpha$ that lies on one side on $\Pi$ and has ends on $\Pi$ and these ends are distinct from the ends of $\alpha$.

Let us remove the arc $\alpha_1$ from $\alpha$ and exchange it to the reflection of $\alpha_1$ across $\Pi$.
Note that the obtained curve, say $\beta$, lies in the surface; it has the same length as $\alpha$, and it connects the same pair of points, say $p$ and $q$.
Therefore $\beta$ is another shortest path from $p$ to $q$ that is distinct from $\alpha$.

By \ref{prop:gamma''}, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are geodesics.
Since $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have a common subarc, they share one point and velocity vector at this point;
by \ref{prop:geod-existence} $\alpha$ coinsides with $\beta$ --- a contradiction.

Equip $\Sigma$ with unit normal field $\Norm$ that points inside.
Denote by $k(t)$ the normal curvature of $\Sigma$ at $\gamma(t)$ in the direction of $\gamma'(t)$.
Since $\Sigma$ is convex $k(t)\ge 0$ for any $t$.

Since $\gamma$ is geodesic, we have $\gamma''(t)=k(t)\cdot\Norm(\gamma(t))$.

Since $\gamma$ has unit speed, $\langle\gamma'(t),\gamma'(t)\rangle=1$ for any $t$.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that $p$ is the origin of~$\RR^3$.
Since $p$ is inside $\Sigma$, we have that $\langle\gamma(t),\Norm(\gamma(t))\rangle\le 0$ for any $t$.
It follows that 
\[\langle\gamma''(t),\gamma(t)\rangle=k(t)\cdot \langle\gamma(t),\Norm(\gamma(t))\rangle\le 0\]
for any $t$.

Applying the above estimates, we get that 
\begin{align*}

Applying scaling, we may assume that the speed is 1.
In this case 
\[\gamma''(t)=k_g(t)\cdot \mu(t)-k_n(t)\cdot \Norm(t).\]
Since $\gamma''(t)\perp\T_{\gamma(t)}$ we get that $k_g=0$. 
That proves the ``only if'' part.

Now assume that $\gamma$ has constant speed.
Againg, applying scaling, we may assume that the speed is 1.

Show that $\exp_p$ is regular at $\vec v$ if $b(r,\theta)\ne 0$.
Conclude that $\exp_p$ is regular in $B\backslash \{0\}$.

By \ref{obs:d(exp)=1}, $\exp_p$ is regular at $0$.
Whence $\exp_p|_B$ is a regular injective smooth map;
therefore it is a diffeomorphism. 
 



\parbf{\ref{lem:K(orthogonal)}}; \ref{SHORT.lem:K(orthogonal):uu-vv}.
Since the frame $\vec u, \vec v,\Norm$ is orthonormal,
first two vector identities are equivalent to the following six real identities:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\langle\vec u_u,\vec u\rangle
&=0,
&
\langle\vec u_u,\vec v\rangle
&=-\tfrac1{b}\cdot a_v,
&
\langle\vec u_u,\Norm\rangle
&=a\cdot \ell,
\\
\langle\vec v_u,\vec v\rangle
&=0,
&
\langle\vec v_u,\vec u\rangle
&=
\tfrac1{b}\cdot a_v,
&
\langle\vec v_u,\Norm\rangle
&=
a\cdot m.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:key-orthogonal/2}
\]

Taking partial derivative of the identities
$\langle\vec u,\vec u\rangle=1$ and
$\langle\vec v,\vec v\rangle=1$ by $u$
we get the first two identities in \ref{eq:key-orthogonal/2}.

Further, observe that
\[
\begin{aligned}
\vec v_u
&=
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial v}
(\tfrac1b\cdot  s_v)=\tfrac1b\cdot s_{uv}
+
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial u}(\tfrac1b)
\cdot
 s_v.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:dv/du}
\]
Since $s_u\perp s_v$, it follows that
\begin{align*}
\langle\vec v_u,\vec u\rangle
&=
\tfrac1{a\cdot b}\cdot \langle s_{vu}, s_u\rangle
=
\tfrac1{2\cdot a\cdot b}\cdot \tfrac{\partial}{\partial v}\langle s_u, s_u\rangle=
\tfrac1{2\cdot a\cdot b}\cdot \tfrac{\partial a^2}{\partial v}=
\tfrac1{b}\cdot a_v.
\end{align*}
Taking partial derivative of
$\langle\vec u,\vec v\rangle=0$  by $u$
we get
we get
\begin{align*}
\langle\vec v_u,\vec u\rangle+
\langle\vec v,\vec u_u\rangle
&=0.
\end{align*}
Hence we get two more identities in \ref{eq:key-orthogonal/2}.

Since $\vec u, \vec v$ is an orthonormal frame, by \ref{ex:shape-chart} we have
\[
\begin{aligned}
\tfrac1{a^2}
\cdot
\langle s_{uu},\Norm\rangle
&=\ell,
&
\tfrac1{a\cdot b}
\cdot
\langle s_{uv},\Norm\rangle
&=m,
\\
\tfrac1{a\cdot b}
\cdot
\langle s_{vu},\Norm\rangle
&=m,
&
\tfrac1{b^2}
\cdot
\langle s_{vv},\Norm\rangle
&=n.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:shape-lmn}
\]

Applying  \ref{eq:dv/du}, \ref{eq:shape-lmn}, and $s_v\perp\Norm$ we get
\begin{align*}
\langle\vec u_u,\Norm\rangle
&=
\tfrac1{a}\cdot \langle s_{uu},\Norm\rangle
=a\cdot \ell,
&
\langle\vec v_u,\Norm\rangle
&=
\tfrac1{a}\cdot \langle s_{uv},\Norm\rangle
=a\cdot m,
\end{align*}
that implies the last two equalities in \ref{eq:key-orthogonal/2}.

Therefore the first two identities in \ref{SHORT.lem:K(orthogonal):uu-vv} are proved;
the remaining two identities can be proved along the same lines.

Recall that the Gauss curvature equals to the determinant of the matrix $
(\begin{smallmatrix}
\ell&m
\\
m&n
\end{smallmatrix}
)
$;
that is, $K=\ell\cdot n-m^2$.
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
a\cdot b\cdot K
&=
a\cdot b\cdot(\ell\cdot n-m^2)
=
\langle\vec u_u,\vec v_v\rangle 
-
\langle\vec u_v,\vec v_u\rangle
\\
&= 
\left(
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial v}
\langle\vec u_u,\vec v\rangle
-
\cancel{\langle\vec u_{uv},\vec v\rangle}
\right)-
\left(
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial u}
\langle\vec u_v,\vec v\rangle
-
\cancel{\langle\vec u_{uv},\vec v\rangle}
\right)=
\\
&=\tfrac{\partial}{\partial v}(-\tfrac1{b}\cdot a_v)
-
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial u}(\tfrac1{a}\cdot b_u).
\end{align*}

For \ref{SHORT.ex:open-comparison:almost-min}, argue by contradiction;
if the statement does not hold then for any $p\in\Sigma$ there is a point $q=q(p)\in \Sigma$ such that

Start with any point $p_0$ and consider a sequence $p_n$ defined by $p_{n+1}\z=q(p_n)$.
Show that $p_n$ converges and $R_{p_n}\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$.

Consider the pentagon $\Delta$ with induced length-metric.
Note that all its angles cannot exceed $\pi$.
Repeat the proof of \ref{thm:comp:toponogov} to show that the comparison holds in $\Delta$.

Now choose a vertex $v$ of $\Delta$, subdivide its sides so that each arc of the subdivision is a minimizing geodesic, so the boundary of $\Delta$ is a broken geodesic.
Divide $\Delta$ into triangles by joining $v$ to other vertexes of the broken geodesic.
Take a model triangle for each so that they share sides as in $\Delta$.
Use the comparison to show that these plane triangles form a required polygon.

It is sufficient to prove the Jensen inequality;

\]


Let $\delta$ be the geodesic path from $\gamma_2(0)$ to $\gamma_1(1)$.
From \ref{ex:midpoints}, we have
\begin{align*}
\dist{\gamma_1(\tfrac12)}{\delta(\tfrac12)}{}
&\le
\tfrac12\cdot\dist{\gamma_1(0)}{\delta(0)}{},
\\
\dist{\delta(\tfrac12)}{\gamma_2(\tfrac12)}{}

Choose two points $x,z\in\Sigma$;
let $y$ be the midpoint of $[xz]$.
Denote by $\bar x$ and $\bar z$ the points on $\delta$ that minimize the distances to $x$ and $z$ respectively;
so we have
$f(x)
=|x-\bar x|_\Sigma$,
and $f(z)=|z-\bar z|_\Sigma$.

Since $\Delta$ is convex, the midpoint of $[\bar x\bar z]$, say  $\bar y$, lies in $\Delta$.
By \ref{ex:convex-dist}, we have 
\begin{align*}
f(y)&\le |y-\bar y|_\Sigma
\le
\tfrac12\cdot(|x-\bar x|_\Sigma
+
|z-\bar z|_\Sigma)
=
\tfrac12\cdot(f(x)+f(z)).
\end{align*}
Observe that this inequality implies convexity of $f$.

Suppose $\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic in $\Delta$ and $\gamma(0)=p$. 
Let $q$ be a point on $\delta$ that minimize the distance to $p$.
Denote by $\phi$ the angle between $\gamma$ and $[pq]$ at $p$.
Note that it is sufficient to show that 
\[f\circ\gamma(t)\le |p-q|_\Sigma+t\cdot\cos\phi\eqlbl{eq:dist<cosphi}\]
for $t$ sufficiently close to $0$.

Chose small $t>0$ and set $x\z=\gamma(t)$.
Consider a model triangle $[\tilde p\tilde q\tilde x]\z=\tilde\triangle(pqx)$.
Let $\tilde\delta$ be the line thru $\tilde q$ perpendicular to $[\tilde p\tilde q]$.
Denote by $\tilde y$ the orthogonal projection of $\tilde x$ to $\tilde\delta$.
By comparison we have that 
\begin{align*}
\phi
=\measuredangle\hinge qpx
&\ge \angk qpx
\mathrel{=:}\tilde\phi,
\\
\psi\df
\measuredangle\hinge pqx
&\ge 
\angk pqx
\mathrel{=:}\tilde \psi
\end{align*}

Since $t=|\tilde p-\tilde x|_{\RR^2}$ is small, so is the distances $|\tilde q-\tilde y|_{\RR^2}$.
Therefore we can choose a point $y$ on $\delta$ such that $|q-y|_\Sigma=|\tilde q-\tilde y|_{\RR^2}$.
Moreover, if we choose in on the \emph{right side}, then $\tfrac\pi2-\psi \ge \measuredangle\hinge qxy$.
By construction and comparison, we have 
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle\hinge {\tilde q}{\tilde x}{\tilde y}&=\tfrac\pi2-\tilde\psi
\ge
\tfrac\pi2-\psi
\ge
\measuredangle\hinge q x y
\ge 
\angk q x y.
\end{align*}
Therefore $|x-y|_\Sigma\le |\tilde x-\tilde y|_{\RR}$.
Since $\tilde\phi\le\phi$, we get that
\begin{align*}
f\circ\gamma(t)&\le |x-y|_\Sigma\le 
|\tilde x-\tilde y|_{\RR}=
|p-q|_\Sigma+t\cdot\cos\tilde\phi
\le
|p-q|_\Sigma+t\cdot\cos\phi.
\end{align*}
That is, we proved \ref{eq:dist<cosphi} for small $t>0$.
The case $t<0$ can be done along the same lines.

Choose a sequence of points $x_n\in K$ that escapes to infinity; that is, such that $\dist{p}{x_n}{\Sigma}\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$.
Denote by $\vec u_n\in\T_p$ the unit vector in the direction of $[px_n]$.
Let $\vec u_\infty$ be a partial limit of $\vec u_n$.

Show that the geodesic that starts from $p$ in the direction of $\vec u_\infty$ is a half-line that runs in $K$.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:half-line:suplevel}.} The concavity of $f$ follows from \ref{prop:busemann+}.
Whence the convexity of $S_c$ follows.

If $S_c$ is not compact then by \ref{SHORT.ex:half-line:exist} there is a half-line $\lambda$ that starts at $p$ and runs in $S_c$ for some $c$.
It remains to observe that $f\circ\lambda(t)+t=0$ and use it to arrive to a contradiction.

Show that 
\[f(x)-c=\Dist_{\partial S_c}x\]

Since $S_s$ is convex, the first part follows.

In the Euclidean plane $S_s$ is a single point.
In the cylinder, $S_s$ is a circle.
The surface of $r$-neighborhood of infinite rectangle provides an example with a line segment as $S_s$; this example is not smooth, but it can be smoothed keeping this property.
