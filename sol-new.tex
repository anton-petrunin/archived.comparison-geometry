Let $\alpha$ be a path connecting $p$ to $q$.

Passing to a subinterval if necessary,
we can assume that $\alpha(t)\ne p,q$ for $t\ne0,1$.

An open set $\Omega$ in $(0,1)$ will be called {}\emph{suitable}
if for any connected component $(a,b)$ of $\Omega$ we have $\alpha(a)=\alpha(b)$.
Show that the union of nested suitable sets is suitable.
Therefore we can find a maximal suitable set $\hat \Omega$.

Define $\beta(t)=\alpha(a)$ for any $t$ in a connected component $(a,b)\subset\Omega$.
Note that for any $x\in [0,1]$ the set $\beta^{-1}\{\beta(x)\}$ is connected.

It remains to re-parametrize $\beta$ to make it injective.
In other words we need to construct a non-decreasing surjective function $\tau\:[0,1]\z\to[0,1]$ such that 
$\tau(t_1)=\tau(t_2)$ if and only if there is a connected component $(a,b)$ such that $t_1,t_2\z\in [a,b]$.
The construction is similar to the construction of devil's staircase.


\parbf{\ref{ex:L-shape}.}
Denote the union of two half-axis by $L$.
Observe that $f(t)\to\infty$ as $t\to \infty$.
Since $f(0)=0$, the intermediate value theorem implies that $f(t)$ takes all nonnegative values for $t\ge 0$.
Use it to show that $L$ is the range of $\alpha$.

Note that the function $f$
is smooth.
Indeed, the existence of all derivatives $f^{(n)}(x)$ at $x\ne 0$ is evident and direct calculations show that $f^{(n)}(0)=0$ for all $n$.
Therefore $t\mapsto \alpha(t)=(f(t),f(-t))$ is smooth as well.

Further, show that the function $f$ is strictly increasing for $t> 0$,
and, moreover, if $0<t_0<t_1$, then $0<f(t_0)<f(t_1)$.
Use it to show that the maps $t\mapsto \alpha(t)$ is injective.

Summarizing we get that $\alpha$ is a smooth parametrization of $L$. 

Now suppose $\beta\:t\mapsto (x(t),y(t))$ is a smooth parameterization of~$L$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that $x(0)=y(0)=0$.
Note that $x(t)\ge 0$ for any $t$ therefore $x'(0)=0$.
The same way we get that $y'(0)=0$.
That is, $\beta'(0)=0$;
so $L$ does not admit a smooth regular parameterization.

For \ref{SHORT.ex:cycloid:regular} you need to check that $\gamma'_\ell\ne 0$.

For $\ell=0$ the system describes a pair of points $(0,0,\pm1)$, so we can assume that $\ell\ne 0$.
Note that first equation desribes the unit sphere centered at the origin
and the second equation describes a cylinder over the circle in the $(x,y)$-plane with diameter with opposite points $(0,0)$ and $(0,\ell)$.


For $\ell\ne 0$,
find the gradients $\nabla f$ and $\nabla h$ for the functions
\begin{align*}
 f(x,y,z)&=x^2+y^2+z^2-1
 \\
 h(x,y,z)&=x^2+\ell\cdot x+y^2
\end{align*}
and show that they are linearly dependent only on the $x$-axis.
Conclude that for $\ell\ne\pm 1$ each connected component of the set of solutions is a smooth regular curve.

Show that 
\begin{itemize}
\item if $|\ell|<1$, then the set has two connected components with $z>0$ and $z<0$.
\item if $|\ell|\ge1$, then the set is connected.
\end{itemize}

Note that the condition on gradients provides only sufficient condition.
Therefore he case $\ell=\pm1$ has to be checked by hands.
In this case a neighborhood of $(\pm1,0,0)$ does not admit a smooth regular parametrization --- try to prove it. %???+PIC

\parit{Remark.}
In the case $\ell=\pm1$ it is called \emph{Viviani's curve}.

Fix a partition $0=t_0<\dots <t_n=1$ of $[0,1]$.
Set $\tau_0=0$ and $\tau_i=\max\set{\tau \in[0,1]}{\beta(\tau_i)=\alpha(t_i)}$.
Show that $(\tau_i)$ is a partition of $[0,1]$;
that is, $0=\tau_0<\tau_1<\dots<\tau_n=1$.

By construction 
\begin{align*}
|\alpha(t_0)&-\alpha(t_1)|+|\alpha(t_1)-\alpha(t_2)|+\dots+|\alpha(t_{n-1})-\alpha(t_n)|=
\\
&=
|\beta(\tau_0)-\beta(\tau_1)|+|\beta(\tau_1)-\beta(\tau_2)|+\dots+|\beta(\tau_{n-1})-\beta(\tau_n)|.
\end{align*}
Since the partition $(t_i)$ is arbitrary, we get 
\[\length \beta\ge \length \alpha.\]

\parit{Remark.}
Note that the partition $(\tau_i)$ is not arbitrary, therefore the inequality might be strict; it might happen if $\beta$ runs back and forth along $\alpha$.

Choose a closed polygonal line $p_1\dots p_n$ inscribed in $\beta$.
By \ref{cor:convex=>rectifiable}, we can assume that it length is arbitrary close to the length of $\beta$;
that is, given $\eps>0$ 
\[\length (p_1\dots p_n)>\length\beta-\eps.\]

Show that we may assume in addition that each point $p_i$ lies on $\alpha$.

Observe that since $\alpha$ is simple, the points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ appear on $\alpha$ in the same cyclic order;
that is, the polygonal line $p_1\dots p_n$ is also inscribed in $\alpha$.
In particular 
\[\length\alpha\ge \length (p_1\dots p_n).\]
It follows that 
\[\length\alpha>\length\beta-\eps.\]
for any $\eps>0$.
Whence 
\[\length\alpha\ge\length\beta.\]

If $\alpha$ has self-intersections, then the points $p_1,\dots, p_n$ might appear on $\alpha$ in a different order, say $p_{i_1},\dots,p_{i_n}$.

Denote by $\ell_u$ the line segment 
obtained orthogonal projection of $\gamma$ to the line in the direction $u$.
Note that $\gamma_u$ runs back and forth along $\ell_u$, we get 
\[\length\gamma_u\ge 2\cdot\length\ell_u.\]
Applying the Crofton formula, we get that 
\[\length\gamma\ge \pi\cdot \overline{\length\ell_u}.\]

In the case of equality, the curve $\gamma_u$ runs exactly back and forth along $\ell_u$ without additional zigzags for almost all (and therefore for all) $u$.

Let $K$ be a closed set bounded by $\gamma$.
Observe that the last statement implies that every line may intersect $K$ only along a closed segment.
In other words $K$ is convex.

\parbf{\ref{adex:more-croftons}.}
The proof is identical to the proof of the standard Crofton formula.
To find the coefficient one has to find average length of projection of unit vector to a line.
Which can be done by integration.

&
\frac1{k_b}&=\frac{1}{\area \SS^2}\cdot\int_{\SS^2} \sqrt{1-x^2}.

The ``only-if'' part is trivial.
To show the ``if'' part, assume $A$ is not convex;
that is, there are points $x,y\in A$ and a point $z\notin A$ that lies between $x$ and $y$.

Since $A$ is closed, its complement is open.
That is, the ball $B(z,\eps)$ does not intersect $A$ for some $\eps>0$.

Show that there is $\delta>0$ such that any path of length at most $|z-y|_{\RR^3}+\delta$ pass thru $B(z,\eps)$.
It follows that $|z-y|_A\ge |z-y|_{\RR^3}+\delta$, 
in particular$|z-y|_A\ne |z-y|_{\RR^3}$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:bisection-of-S2}.}
Assume contrary, then by the hemisphere lemma (\ref{lem:hemisphere}) $\gamma$ lies in an open hemisphere.
In particular it cannot divide $\SS^2$ into two regions of equal area --- a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{ex:flaw}.}
The very first sentence is wrong --- it is \emph{not} sufficient to show that diameter iis at most 2.
For example an equilateral triangle with circumradius slightly above $1$ may have diameter (which is defined as the maximal distance between its points) slightly bigger than $\sqrt3$, so it can be made smaller that $2$.
%???+PIC

On the other hand, it is easy to modify the proof of the hemisphere lemma (\ref{lem:hemisphere}) to get a correct solution.
That is, (1) choose two points $p$ and $q$ on $\gamma$ that divide it into two arcs of the same length;
(2) set $z$ to be a midpoint of $p$ and $q$,
and (3) show that $\gamma$ lies in the unit disc centered at $z$.

Consider a \emph{diangle} $pq$ (that is, a closed polygonal line with two vertexes $p$ and $q$).
Observe that both external angles of the diangle have measure $\pi$.
Therefore the total curvature of diangle is $2\cdot \pi$.

It remains to apply the definition of total curvature for arbitrary curves (\ref{def:total-curv-poly}).

Observe that if $\tc\gamma\le 1$, then
\[\length\gamma\le 2\cdot|\gamma(b)-\gamma(a)|.
\eqlbl{eq:arc<2chord}\]
Indeed, if $\tc\gamma\le 1$, then from the definition of total curvature [\ref{def:total-curv-poly}] it follows that for any polygonal line $p0\dots p_n$ inscribed in $\gamma$ the angle between any pair of edges does noe exceed $1$.
Let $q_i$ be the orthogonal projection of $p_i$ to the line of its first edge $p_0p_1$.
By the angle estimate, we have that the points $q_0,\dots,q_n$ appear on the line in the same order and 
\[|q_i-q_{i-1}|> \tfrac12\cdot|p_i-p_{i-1}|.\]
Therefore 
\begin{align*}|\gamma(b)-\gamma(a)|&=|p_n-p_0|\ge 
\\
&\ge |q_n-q_0|=
\\
&=|q_n-q_{n-1}|+\dots+|q_1-q_0|>
\\
&>\tfrac12\cdot(|p_n-p_{n-1}|+\dots+|p_1-p_0|).
\end{align*}
Recall that length of $\gamma$ is defined as the exact upper bound for the  sum $|p_n-p_{n-1}|+\dots+|p_1-p_0|$.
Therefore \ref{eq:arc<2chord} follows.

In general, if $\tc\gamma$ is bounded, we can subdivide $\gamma$ into arcs with total curvature at most $1$,
apply the above argument to each of arc and sum up the results.

One may be able to see the following geometrically, without calculations (or at least use the following observation to check the calculations).
Suppose $\tg\theta\z=b/a$, then $\tan(0)\z=(0,\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$, $\norm(0)\z=(-1,0,0)$, $\bi(0)\z=(0,\sin\theta, -\cos\theta)$.
Moreover if the helix is parameterized with arc-length then its Frenet frame rotates around $z$-axis with the angular velocity $\cos\theta$. 
%???PIC

If the calculations done right, then you should see that curvature $\kur$ and torsion $\tau$ do not depend on time and given.

Observe that
\[\gamma'_a(t)=(1+a\cdot \cos t, -a\cdot \sin t);\]

If $|a|>1$ then $\tan_a(t)=\gamma'_a/|\gamma'_a|$ runs clockwise and makes full turn in time $2\cdot\pi$.
It follows that if $|a|>1$, then
\[\Psi(\gamma_a)=-2\cdot\pi,\quad \tc\gamma_a=|\Psi(\gamma_a)|=2\cdot\pi.\]

If $|a|<1$, set $\theta_a=\arcsin a$.
Note that $\tan_a(t)=\gamma'_a/|\gamma'_a|$ starts with the horizontal direction $\tan_a(0)=(1,0)$, turns monotonically to angle $\theta_a$, then monotonically to $-\theta_a$ and then monotonically to back to $\tan_a(2\cdot\pi)=(1,0)$.
It follows that if $|a|>1$, then
\[\Psi(\gamma_a)=0,\quad \tc{\gamma_a}=4\cdot\theta_a.\]

In the cases $a=-1$ the velocity $\gamma'_{-1}(t)$ vanish at $t=0$ and $2\cdot\pi$.
Nevertheless, the curve admits a smooth regular parametrization --- show it.
In this case $\Psi(\gamma_{-1})=-\pi$ and $\tc{\gamma_{-1}}=\pi$.

In the cases $a=1$ the velocity $\gamma'_1(t)$ vanish at $t=\pi$.
At $t=\pi$ the curve has a cusp;
that is 
\[\lim_{t\to\pi-}\tan_1(t)=-\lim_{t\to\pi+}\tan_1(t).\]
So $\gamma_1(t)$ has undefined total signed curvature.
The curve is a joint of two smooth arcs with external angle $\pi$,
the total curvature of each arc is $\tfrac\pi2$, so 
$\tc{\gamma_{1}}=\tfrac\pi2+\pi+\tfrac\pi2=2\cdot\pi$.

%in particular, $\ell$ cannot be tangent to both $\sigma_p$ and $\sigma_q$ --- a contradiction. 

%\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:double-tangent:b}.}
%If a circle $\sigma$ is tangent to $\gamma$ at three points $x$, $y$, and $z$.
%Then $\sigma$ is tangent to the osculating circles $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$.
%By \ref{lem:spiral} we can assume that $\sigma_x$ is surrounded by $\sigma_y$ and $\sigma_y$ is surrounded by $\sigma_z$.
%Observe that the first statement implies that $\sigma$ is squeezed between $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$.
%The second statement implies that $\sigma$ is squeezed between $\sigma_y$ and $\sigma_z$.
%These two statements contradict each other.

Apply the spiral lemma (\ref{lem:spiral}).

\parbf{\ref{ex:support}.} Consider the coordinate system with $p$ as the origin and $x$-axis as the common tangent line to $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$.
We may assume that $\gamma_i$ are defined in $(-\eps,\eps)$ for some small $\eps>0$,
so that they run almost horizontally to the right.

Given $t\in[0,1]$ consider the curve $\gamma_t$ that is tangent and cooriented to the $x$ axis at  $\gamma_t(0)$ and has signed curvature defined by $\skur_t(s)=(1-t)\cdot\skur_0(s)+t\cdot\skur_1(s)$.
It exists by \ref{thm:fund-curves-2D}.

Fix $s\approx 0$.
Consider the curve $\alpha_s\:t\mapsto \gamma_t(s)$.
Show that $\alpha_s$ moves almost vertically up, while $\gamma_t$ moves almost horizontally to the right.
Conclude that in a small neighborhood of $p$, the curve $\gamma_1$
lies above $\gamma_0$.
Whence the statement follows.

\parbf{\ref{ex:in-circle}.} Let reduce the radius of the circle until it touches $\gamma$.
Observe that the circle supports $\gamma$ and apply \ref{prop:supporting-circline}.


\parbf{\ref{ex:between-parallels-1}, \ref{ex:in-triangle} and \ref{ex:lens}.}
Observe that one of the arcs of curvature 1 in the families shown on the diagram suppots $\gamma$ and apply \ref{prop:supporting-circline}.

To do the second part in \ref{ex:between-parallels-1}, use shown family and another family of arcs curved in the opposite direction.


\parbf{\ref{ex:convex small}.}
Note that we can assume that $\gamma$ bounds a convex figure $F$, otherwise by \ref{prop:convex} its curvature changes the sign and therefore it has zero curvature at some point.
Choose two points $x$ and $y$ surrounded by $\gamma$ such that $|x-y|>2$,
look at the maximal lens bounded by two arcs with common chord $xy$ that lies in $F$ and apply supporting test (\ref{prop:supporting-circline}).

\parbf{\ref{ex:line-curve-intersections}}; \ref{SHORT.ex:line-curve-intersections:a}.
Apply the lens lemma to show that if $p_2$ lies between $p_1$ and $p_3$, then the curvature of $\gamma$ switches its sign.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:line-curve-intersections:b}.} Show that in this $p_4$ lies between $p_2$ and $p_3$;
further $p_5$ lies between $p_3$ and $p_4$;
and so on.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:line-curve-intersections:b}.}
According to \ref{SHORT.ex:line-curve-intersections:a}, the point $p_3$ might lie between $p_1$ and $p_2$ and then further order is determined uniquely or $p_1$ lies between $p_2$ and $p_3$.
In the latter case we have two choices, either $p_4$ lies between $p_2$ and $p_3$ and then then further order is determined uniquely or $p_2$ lies between $p_3$ and $p_4$.
In the latter case we get a choice again.

Assume we make a first choice on the step number $k$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that $p_k$ lies to the right from $p_{k-2}$.
Then we have the following order:
\[
p_{k-2},p_{p-4},\dots,p_{p-5},p_{k-3},p_k,p_{k+2},\dots,p_{k+1},p_{k-1}.
\]

\parbf{\ref{ex:curve-crosses-circle}.}
Repeat the proof of theorem for each cyclic concatenation of an arc of $\gamma$ from $p_i$ to $p_{i+1}$ with large arc of the circle. 

\parbf{\ref{ex:hyperboloinds}.} 
Denote the set of solutions by $\Phi_\ell$.

Show that $\nabla_p f=0$ if and only if $p=(0,0,0)$.
Use \ref{prop:implicit-surface} to conclude that if $\ell\ne 0$, then $\Phi_\ell$ is a union of disjoint smooth regular surfaces.

Show that $\Phi_\ell$ is connected if and only if $\ell\le 0$.
It follows that if $\ell<0$, then $\Phi_\ell$ is a smooth regular surface and if $\ell>0$ then it is not.

The case $\ell=0$ has to be done by hands --- it does not satisfy the sufficient condition in \ref{prop:implicit-surface}, but it does not solely imply that $\Phi_0$ is not a smooth surface.

Show that any neighborhood of origin in $\Phi_0$ can not be described by a graph in any coordinate system;
so by the definition (page \pageref{page:def-smooth-surface}) $\Phi_0$ is not a smooth surface.

\parbf{\ref{ex:inversion-chart}.} 
First check that the image of $s$ lies in the the unit sphere centered at $(0,0,1)$;
that is show that 
\[\left(\tfrac{2\cdot u}{1+u^2+v^2}\right)^2
+
\left(\tfrac{2\cdot v}{1+u^2+v^2}\right)^2
+\left(\tfrac{2}{1+u^2+v^2}-1\right)^2=1.\]
for any $u$ and $v$.

Further, show that the map 
\[(x,y,z)\mapsto (\tfrac{2\cdot x}{x^2+y^2+z^2},\tfrac{2\cdot y}{x^2+y^2+z^2})\]
describe the inverse map which is continuous away from the origin.
In particular, $s$ is an embedding that covers whole sphere except the origin.

It remains to show that $s$ is regular; that is, $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}$ and $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}$ are linearly independent at all points of the $(u,v)$-plane.

\parbf{\ref{ex:revolution}.}
Set
\[s\:(t,\theta)\mapsto (x(t), y(t)\cdot\cos\theta,y(t)\cdot\sin\theta).\]
Show that $s$ is regular; that is, $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial t}$ and $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial \theta}$ are linearly independent (in fact $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial t}\perp\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial \theta}$).

Show that $s$ is local embedding; that is, any $(t_0,\theta_0)$ admits a neighborhood $U$ in the $(t,\theta)$-plane such that the restriction $s|_U$ has a continuous inverse.
It remains to apply \ref{cor:reg-parmeterization}.

There are mean-convex bodies bodies $V$ that are not star-shaped for which the conclusion of the exercise does not hold.
For example they can be found among bodies of revolution as shown on the picture --- one only has to check that mirror-symmetric figures $F$ and $F'$ as on the picture can be chosen in such a way that the body of revolution of $F$ is mean-convex wile the body of revolution of $F'$ has smaller surface area. 

A proof of this stronger statement can be build on an analog of comparison theorem \ref{thm:comp}(\ref{thm:comp:toponogov}) for surfaces with Gauss curvature at least~1.

Observe that the Gauss curvature of the surface of revolution of the graph $y=a\cdot \sin x$ for $x\in(0,\pi)$ cannot exceed $1$ (Use \ref{ex:curvature-graph} and \ref{cor:meusnier}).
Try to support the surface $\Sigma$ from inside by a surface of revolution of the described type. 

\parit{Remark.}
In fact if Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is at least $1$,
then
the intrinsic diameter of $\Sigma$ can not exceed $\pi$.
The latter means that any two points in $\Sigma$ can be connected by a path that lies in $\Sigma$ and has length at most~$\pi$.
