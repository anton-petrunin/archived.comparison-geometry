\parbf{\ref{ex:close-open}.}
Suppose the complement $\Omega=\mathcal{X}\backslash Q$ is open.
Then for each point $p\in \Omega$ there is $\eps>0$ such that $|p-q|_{\spc{X}}>\eps$ for any $q\in Q$.
It follows that $p$ is not a limit point of any sequence $q_n\in Q$.
That is, any limit of points in $Q$ lies in $Q$ which by definition means that $Q$ is closed.

Now suppose $\Omega=\mathcal{X}\backslash Q$ is not open.
Then there is a point $p\in \Omega$ such that for any natural $n$ there is a point $q_n\in Q$ such that $|p-q_n|_{\spc{X}}\z<\tfrac 1n$; in particular $q_n\to p$ and $n\to \infty$.
Since $p\notin Q$, we get that $Q$ is not closed.

Let $\alpha$ be a path connecting $p$ to $q$.

Passing to a subinterval if necessary,
we can assume that $\alpha(t)\ne p,q$ for $t\ne0,1$.

An open set $\Omega$ in $(0,1)$ will be called {}\emph{suitable}
if for any connected component $(a,b)$ of $\Omega$ we have $\alpha(a)=\alpha(b)$.
Show that the union of nested suitable sets is suitable.
Therefore we can find a maximal suitable set $\hat \Omega$.

Define $\beta(t)=\alpha(a)$ for any $t$ in a connected component $(a,b)\subset\Omega$.
Note that for any $x\in [0,1]$ the set $\beta^{-1}\{\beta(x)\}$ is connected.

It remains to re-parametrize $\beta$ to make it injective.
In other words we need to construct a non-decreasing surjective function $\tau\:[0,1]\z\to[0,1]$ such that 
$\tau(t_1)=\tau(t_2)$ if and only if there is a connected component $(a,b)$ such that $t_1,t_2\z\in [a,b]$.
The construction is similar to the construction of devil's staircase.


\parbf{\ref{ex:L-shape}.}
Denote the union of two half-axis by $L$.
Observe that $f(t)\to\infty$ as $t\to \infty$.
Since $f(0)=0$, the intermediate value theorem implies that $f(t)$ takes all nonnegative values for $t\ge 0$.
Use it to show that $L$ is the range of~$\alpha$.

Note that the function $f$
is smooth.
Indeed, the existence of all derivatives $f^{(n)}(x)$ at $x\ne 0$ is evident and direct calculations show that $f^{(n)}(0)=0$ for all $n$.
Therefore $t\mapsto \alpha(t)=(f(t),f(-t))$ is smooth as well.

Further, show that the function $f$ is strictly increasing for $t> 0$,
and, moreover, if $0<t_0<t_1$, then $0<f(t_0)<f(t_1)$.
Use it to show that the maps $t\mapsto \alpha(t)$ is injective.

Summarizing we get that $\alpha$ is a smooth parametrization of $L$.

Now suppose $\beta\:t\mapsto (x(t),y(t))$ is a smooth parameterization of~$L$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that $x(0)=y(0)=0$.
Note that $x(t)\ge 0$ for any $t$ therefore $x'(0)=0$.
The same way we get that $y'(0)=0$.
That is, $\beta'(0)=0$;
so $L$ does not admit a smooth regular parameterization.

For \ref{SHORT.ex:cycloid:regular} you need to check that $\gamma'_\ell\ne 0$.

For $\ell=0$ the system describes a pair of points $(0,0,\pm1)$, so we can assume that $\ell\ne 0$.

Conclude that for $\ell\ne\pm 1$ each connected component of the set of solutions is a smooth regular curve.

Show that 
\begin{itemize}
\item if $|\ell|<1$, then the set has two connected components with $z>0$ and $z<0$.
\item if $|\ell|\ge1$, then the set is connected.

Note that the condition on gradients provides only sufficient condition.
Therefore he case $\ell=\pm1$ has to be checked by hands.
In this case a neighborhood of $(\pm1,0,0)$ does not admit a smooth regular parametrization --- try to prove it.

\parit{Remark.}
In the case $\ell=\pm1$ it is called \index{Viviani's curve}\emph{Viviani's curve}.

Without loss of generality we may assume that the origin does not lie on the curve.

Show that inversion of the plane $(x,y)\mapsto (\tfrac{x}{x^2+y^2},\tfrac{y}{x^2+y^2})$ maps our curve maps to a closed curve with removed origin.
Apply Jordan's theorem for the obtained curve and use the inversion again.

\parbf{\ref{ex:length-image}.}
Fix a partition $0=t_0<\dots <t_n=1$ of $[0,1]$.
Set $\tau_0=0$ and $\tau_i=\max\set{\tau \in[0,1]}{\beta(\tau_i)=\alpha(t_i)}$.
Show that $(\tau_i)$ is a partition of $[0,1]$;
that is, $0=\tau_0<\tau_1<\dots<\tau_n=1$.

By construction 
\begin{align*}
|\alpha(t_0)&-\alpha(t_1)|+|\alpha(t_1)-\alpha(t_2)|+\dots+|\alpha(t_{n-1})-\alpha(t_n)|=
\\
&=
|\beta(\tau_0)-\beta(\tau_1)|+|\beta(\tau_1)-\beta(\tau_2)|+\dots+|\beta(\tau_{n-1})-\beta(\tau_n)|.
\end{align*}
Since the partition $(t_i)$ is arbitrary, we get 
\[\length \beta\ge \length \alpha.\]

\parit{Remark.}
Note that the partition $(\tau_i)$ is not arbitrary, therefore the inequality might be strict; it might happen if $\beta$ runs back and forth along $\alpha$.

Suppose that $\gamma\:[0,1]\to\RR^2$ is a rectifiable curve and $\gamma_k$ be a scaled copy of $\gamma$ with factor $k>0$;

Show that 
\[\length\gamma_k=k\cdot\length \gamma.\]

Now suppose the arc $\gamma$ of the Koch snowflake shown on the diagram is rectifiable; denote its length by $\ell$.
Evidently $\ell>0$.
Observe that it $\gamma$ can be divided into 4 arcs each of which is a scaled copy of $\gamma$ with factor $\tfrac13$.
It follows that $\ell=\tfrac43\cdot\ell$ --- a contradiction.


\parbf{\ref{ex:arc-length-helix}.} 
We have to assume that $a\ne 0$ or $b\ne0$;
otherwise we get a constant curve.

Choose a closed polygonal line $p_1\dots p_n$ inscribed in $\beta$.
By \ref{cor:convex=>rectifiable}, we can assume that it length is arbitrary close to the length of $\beta$;
that is, given $\eps>0$ 
\[\length (p_1\dots p_n)>\length\beta-\eps.\]

Show that we may assume in addition that each point $p_i$ lies on $\alpha$.

Observe that since $\alpha$ is simple, the points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ appear on $\alpha$ in the same cyclic order;
that is, the polygonal line $p_1\dots p_n$ is also inscribed in $\alpha$.
In particular 
\[\length\alpha\ge \length (p_1\dots p_n).\]
It follows that 
\[\length\alpha>\length\beta-\eps.\]
for any $\eps>0$.
Whence 
\[\length\alpha\ge\length\beta.\]

If $\alpha$ has self-intersections, then the points $p_1,\dots, p_n$ might appear on $\alpha$ in a different order, say $p_{i_1},\dots,p_{i_n}$.

Denote by $\ell_u$ the line segment 
obtained orthogonal projection of $\gamma$ to the line in the direction $u$.
Note that $\gamma_u$ runs back and forth along $\ell_u$, we get 
\[\length\gamma_u\ge 2\cdot\length\ell_u.\]
Applying the Crofton formula, we get that 
\[\length\gamma\ge \pi\cdot \overline{\length\ell_u}.\]

In the case of equality, the curve $\gamma_u$ runs exactly back and forth along $\ell_u$ without additional zigzags for almost all (and therefore for all) $u$.

Let $K$ be a closed set bounded by $\gamma$.
Observe that the last statement implies that every line may intersect $K$ only along a closed segment.
In other words $K$ is convex.

\parbf{\ref{adex:more-croftons}.}
The proof is identical to the proof of the standard Crofton formula.
To find the coefficient one has to find average length of projection of unit vector to a line.
Which can be done by integration.

\frac1{k_a}&=\frac{1}{\area \mathbb{S}^2}\cdot\iint_{\mathbb{S}^2} |x|;
&
\frac1{k_b}&=\frac{1}{\area \mathbb{S}^2}\cdot\iint_{\mathbb{S}^2} \sqrt{1-x^2}.

The answers are $k_a=2$ and $k_b=\tfrac4\pi$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:intrinsic-convex}.}
The ``only-if'' part is trivial.
To show the ``if'' part, assume $A$ is not convex;
that is, there are points $x,y\in A$ and a point $z\notin A$ that lies between $x$ and $y$.

Since $A$ is closed, its complement is open.
That is, the ball $B(z,\eps)$ does not intersect $A$ for some $\eps>0$.

Show that there is $\delta>0$ such that any path of length at most $|z-y|_{\RR^3}+\delta$ pass thru $B(z,\eps)$.
It follows that $|z-y|_A\ge |z-y|_{\RR^3}+\delta$, 
in particular $|z\z-y|_A\z\ne |z\z-y|_{\RR^3}$.

However it has three points $x,y,z$ on one of its sides and their antipodal points $-x,-y,-z$ on the other.
Show that this property is sufficient to conclude that the curve does not lie in any hemisphere.

\parbf{\ref{ex:bisection-of-S2}.}
Assume contrary, then by the hemisphere lemma (\ref{lem:hemisphere}) $\gamma$ lies in an open hemisphere.
In particular it cannot divide $\mathbb{S}^2$ into two regions of equal area --- a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{ex:flaw}.}
The very first sentence is wrong --- it is {}\emph{not} sufficient to show that diameter iis at most 2.
For example an equilateral triangle with circumradius slightly above $1$ may have diameter (which is defined as the maximal distance between its points) slightly bigger than $\sqrt3$, so it can be made smaller that $2$.

On the other hand, it is easy to modify the proof of the hemisphere lemma (\ref{lem:hemisphere}) to get a correct solution.
That is, (1) choose two points $p$ and $q$ on $\gamma$ that divide it into two arcs of the same length;
(2) set $z$ to be a midpoint of $p$ and $q$,
and (3) show that $\gamma$ lies in the unit disc centered at $z$.

By \ref{SHORT.adex:crofton:crofton},

Therefore we can choose $u$ so that

Set $\theta(s)=\measuredangle(\gamma(s),\gamma'(s))$.
Observe that it is sufficient to show that

\eqlbl{|sigma'|<kur-theta'}\]
Moreover, it sufficient to show that \ref{|sigma'|<kur-theta'} holds if $\theta\ne0,\pi$;
that is, if $\sin\theta\ne0$.

Since $\langle\tan,\tan\rangle=1$, we have $\tan'\perp \tan$.
Observe that $\langle \tan,\sigma\rangle=\cos\theta$;
therefore
\begin{align*}
\kappa\cdot \sin\theta&=|\tan'|\cdot \sin\theta\ge
\\
&\ge -\langle \tan',\sigma\rangle=
\\
&= \langle \tan,\sigma'\rangle-\langle \tan,\sigma\rangle'=

&= (|\sigma'|+\theta')\cdot \sin\theta.

Consider a {}\emph{diangle} $pq$ (that is, a closed polygonal line with two vertexes $p$ and $q$).
Observe that both external angles of the diangle have measure $\pi$.
Therefore the total curvature of diangle is $2\cdot \pi$.

It remains to apply the definition of total curvature for arbitrary curves (\ref{def:total-curv-poly}).

\parbf{\ref{ex:tc-length};} \ref{SHORT.ex:tc-length:rectifiable}.
Observe that if $\tc\gamma\le 1$, then
\[\length\gamma\le 2\cdot|\gamma(b)-\gamma(a)|.
\eqlbl{eq:arc<2chord}\]
Indeed, if $\tc\gamma\le 1$, then from the definition of total curvature [\ref{def:total-curv-poly}] it follows that for any polygonal line $p0\dots p_n$ inscribed in $\gamma$ the angle between any pair of edges does noe exceed $1$.
Let $q_i$ be the orthogonal projection of $p_i$ to the line of its first edge $p_0p_1$.
By the angle estimate, we have that the points $q_0,\dots,q_n$ appear on the line in the same order and 
\[|q_i-q_{i-1}|> \tfrac12\cdot|p_i-p_{i-1}|.\]
Therefore 
\begin{align*}|\gamma(b)-\gamma(a)|&=|p_n-p_0|\ge 
\\
&\ge |q_n-q_0|=
\\
&=|q_n-q_{n-1}|+\dots+|q_1-q_0|>
\\
&>\tfrac12\cdot(|p_n-p_{n-1}|+\dots+|p_1-p_0|).
\end{align*}
Recall that length of $\gamma$ is defined as the exact upper bound for the  sum $|p_n-p_{n-1}|+\dots+|p_1-p_0|$.
Therefore \ref{eq:arc<2chord} follows.

In general, if $\tc\gamma$ is bounded, we can subdivide $\gamma$ into arcs with total curvature at most $1$,
apply the above argument to each of arc and sum up the results.

\parbf{\ref{ex:helix-torsion}.} 
The arc-length parameter $s$ is already found in   \ref{ex:arc-length-helix}.

If the calculations done right, then you should see that curvature $\kur$ and torsion $\tau$ do not depend on time and given.
Moreover for any $\kur>0$ and $\tor$ one can find $a$ and $b$ so that the helix $\gamma_{a,b}$ has curvature $\kur$ and torsion~$\tor$.

One may also see it geometrically using that the helix is maped to itself by one parameter family of glide rotations around $z$-axis.
Therefore, for the $t$-parametrization, Frenet frame rotates around $z$-axis with the angular velocity~$1$.
It remains rewrite it for the arc-length parametrization and note that 
\begin{align*}
\tan(0)&=(0,\cos\theta, \sin\theta),
\\
\norm(0)&=(-1,0,0),
\\

Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\gamma_0$ is parameterized by its arc-length.
Then
\begin{align*}
|\gamma_1'|&=|\gamma_0'+\tan'|=|\tan+\kur\cdot\norm|=
\sqrt{1+\kur^2}\ge
1=
|\gamma_0'|;
\end{align*}
that is, $|\gamma_1'(t)|\ge|\gamma_0'(t)|$ for any $t\in[a,b]$
The statement follows since 
\[\length\gamma_i
=
\int_a^b|\gamma_i'(t)|\cdot dt.\]

\parbf{\ref{ex:trochoids}.}
Observe that
\[\gamma'_a(t)=(1+a\cdot \cos t, -a\cdot \sin t);\]
that is, $\gamma'_a$ runs clockwise along a circle with center at $(1,0)$ and radius $1$.
If $|a|>1$ then $\tan_a(t)=\gamma'_a/|\gamma'_a|$ runs clockwise and makes full turn in time $2\cdot\pi$.
It follows that if $|a|>1$, then
\[\Psi(\gamma_a)=-2\cdot\pi,\quad \tc\gamma_a=|\Psi(\gamma_a)|=2\cdot\pi.\]

If $|a|<1$, set $\theta_a=\arcsin a$.
Note that $\tan_a(t)=\gamma'_a/|\gamma'_a|$ starts with the horizontal direction $\tan_a(0)=(1,0)$, turns monotonically to angle $\theta_a$, then monotonically to $-\theta_a$ and then monotonically to back to $\tan_a(2\cdot\pi)=(1,0)$.
It follows that if $|a|>1$, then
\[\Psi(\gamma_a)=0,\quad \tc{\gamma_a}=4\cdot\theta_a.\]

In the cases $a=-1$ the velocity $\gamma'_{-1}(t)$ vanish at $t=0$ and $2\cdot\pi$.
Nevertheless, the curve admits a smooth regular parametrization --- show it.
In this case $\Psi(\gamma_{-1})=-\pi$ and $\tc{\gamma_{-1}}=\pi$.

In the cases $a=1$ the velocity $\gamma'_1(t)$ vanish at $t=\pi$.
At $t=\pi$ the curve has a cusp;
that is, 
\[\lim_{t\to\pi-}\tan_1(t)=-\lim_{t\to\pi+}\tan_1(t).\]
So $\gamma_1(t)$ has undefined total signed curvature.
The curve is a joint of two smooth arcs with external angle $\pi$,
the total curvature of each arc is $\tfrac\pi2$, so 
$\tc{\gamma_{1}}=\tfrac\pi2+\pi+\tfrac\pi2=2\cdot\pi$.

Since $\gamma$ is regular, $\gamma'\ne0$.
Therefore if $\gamma_\ell'(t)=0$, then $\ell\cdot \skur(t)= 1$.

Suppose $|\ell|<\frac{1}{\kur(t)}$ for any $t$.

Observe that if a line or circle is tangent to $\gamma$,
then it is tangent to osculating circle at the same point
and apply the spiral lemma (\ref{lem:spiral}).

\parbf{\ref{ex:vertex-support}.}
Apply the spiral lemma (\ref{lem:spiral}).

\parit{Direct solution.} 
We will assume that curvature does not vanish at $p$, the remaining case is simpler.
We may assume that $\gamma$ is a unit-speed curve and $p=\gamma(0)$.
Further, we may assume that be the center of curvature of $\gamma$ at $p$ is the origin;
in other words, $\kappa(0)\cdot\gamma(0)+ \norm(0)=0$.

Since the osculating circle supports $\gamma$ at $p$,
we get that the function $f\:t\mapsto \langle\gamma(t),\gamma(t)\rangle$ has local minimum or maximum at $0$.

Direct calculations show that 
\begin{align*}
f'
&=\langle\gamma,\gamma\rangle'
=2\cdot\langle\tan,\gamma\rangle,
\\
f''
&=2\cdot\langle\tan,\gamma\rangle'
=2\cdot\langle\tan',\gamma\rangle+2\cdot\langle\tan,\tan\rangle
=2\cdot\kappa\cdot\langle\norm,\gamma\rangle+2,
\\
f'''
&=2\cdot\kappa'\cdot\langle\norm,\gamma\rangle
+2\cdot\kappa\cdot\langle\norm',\gamma\rangle+\cancel{2\cdot\kappa\cdot\langle\norm,\tan\rangle}.
\end{align*}

Observe that $\norm'(0)\perp\gamma(0)$.
Therefore $f'(0)=0$, $f''(0)=0$, and $f'''(0)\z=-2\cdot\kappa'/\kappa$.
Since $f$ is a maximum or minimum at $0$, we get that $f'''(0)=0$ and therefore
$\kappa'=0$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:support}.} Consider the coordinate system with $p$ as the origin and $x$-axis as the common tangent line to $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$.
We may assume that $\gamma_i$ are defined in $(-\eps,\eps)$ for some small $\eps>0$,
so that they run almost horizontally to the right.

Given $t\in[0,1]$ consider the curve $\gamma_t$ that is tangent and cooriented to the $x$ axis at  $\gamma_t(0)$ and has signed curvature defined by $\skur_t(s)=(1\z-t)\cdot\skur_0(s)+t\cdot\skur_1(s)$.
It exists by \ref{thm:fund-curves-2D}.

Fix $s\approx 0$.
Consider the curve $\alpha_s\:t\mapsto \gamma_t(s)$.
Show that $\alpha_s$ moves almost vertically up, while $\gamma_t$ moves almost horizontally to the right.
Conclude that in a small neighborhood of $p$, the curve $\gamma_1$
lies above $\gamma_0$.
Whence the statement follows.

\parbf{\ref{ex:convex small}.}
Note that we can assume that $\gamma$ bounds a convex figure $F$, otherwise by \ref{prop:convex} its curvature changes the sign and therefore it has zero curvature at some point.
Choose two points $x$ and $y$ surrounded by $\gamma$ such that $|x-y|>2$,
look at the maximal lens bounded by two arcs with common chord $xy$ that lies in $F$ and apply supporting test (\ref{prop:supporting-circline}).

\parbf{\ref{ex:line-curve-intersections}}; \ref{SHORT.ex:line-curve-intersections:a}.

further $p_5$ lies between $p_3$ and $p_4$;

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:line-curve-intersections:c}.}
According to \ref{SHORT.ex:line-curve-intersections:a}, the point $p_3$ might lie between $p_1$ and $p_2$ and then further order is determined uniquely or $p_1$ lies between $p_2$ and $p_3$.
In the latter case we have two choices, either $p_4$ lies between $p_2$ and $p_3$ and then further order is determined uniquely or $p_2$ lies between $p_3$ and $p_4$.
In the latter case we get a choice again.

Assume we make a first choice on the step number $k$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that $p_k$ lies to the right from $p_{k-2}$.
Then we have the following order:
\[

Denote the set of solutions by $\Phi_\ell$.

Show that $\nabla_p f=0$ if and only if $p=(0,0,0)$.
Use \ref{prop:implicit-surface} to conclude that if $\ell\ne 0$, then $\Phi_\ell$ is a union of disjoint smooth regular surfaces.

Show that $\Phi_\ell$ is connected if and only if $\ell\le 0$.
It follows that if $\ell<0$, then $\Phi_\ell$ is a smooth regular surface and if $\ell>0$ then it is not.

The case $\ell=0$ has to be done by hands --- it does not satisfy the sufficient condition in \ref{prop:implicit-surface}, but it does not solely imply that $\Phi_0$ is not a smooth surface.

Show that any neighborhood of origin in $\Phi_0$ cannot be described by a graph in any coordinate system;
so by the definition (Section~\ref{sec:def-smooth-surface}) $\Phi_0$ is not a smooth surface.

\parbf{\ref{ex:inversion-chart}.} 
First check that the image of $s$ lies in the unit sphere centered at $(0,0,1)$;
that is, show that

+
\left(\tfrac{2\cdot v}{1+u^2+v^2}\right)^2
+\left(\tfrac{2}{1+u^2+v^2}-1\right)^2=1.\]
for any $u$ and $v$.

Further, show that the map 
\[(x,y,z)\mapsto (\tfrac{2\cdot x}{x^2+y^2+z^2},\tfrac{2\cdot y}{x^2+y^2+z^2})\]
describe the inverse map which is continuous away from the origin.
In particular, $s$ is an embedding that covers whole sphere except the origin.

It remains to show that $s$ is regular; that is, $s_u$ and $s_v$ are linearly independent at all points of the $(u,v)$-plane.

\parbf{\ref{ex:revolution}.}

(It might help to observe that $s_t\perp s_\theta$).

Show that $s$ is local embedding; that is, any $(t_0,\theta_0)$ admits a neighborhood $U$ in the $(t,\theta)$-plane such that the restriction $s|_U$ has a continuous inverse.
It remains to apply \ref{cor:reg-parmeterization}.

\parbf{\ref{ex:star-shaped-disc}.} 
The solutions of these exercises are build on the following general construction known as the \index{Moser trick}\emph{Moser trick}.

Suppose that $\vec u_t$ is a smooth time-dependent vector field on a plane.
Consider the ordinary differential equation $x'(t)=\vec u_t(x(t))$.
Consider the map $\iota\:x(0)\mapsto x(1)$ where $t\mapsto x(t)$ is a solution of the equation.
The map $\iota$ is called \index{flow}\emph{flow} of vector field $\vec u_t$ for the time interval $[0,1]$.
Observe that according to \ref{thm:ODE} the map $\iota$ is smooth in its domain of definition.
Moreover the same holds for its inverse;
indeed $\iota^{-1}$ is the flow for of the vector field $-\vec u_{1-t}$.
That is, $\iota$ is a diffeomorphism from the domain of definition to its image. 


Therefore, in order to construct a diffeomorphism from one open subset of the plane to another it sufficient to construct a smooth vector field such that flow maps one set to the other;
such map is automatically a diffeomorphism.

Suppose $\Sigma=\RR^2\backslash{p_1,\dots,p_n}$ and $\Theta=\RR^2\backslash{q_1,\dots,q_n}$.

$\gamma_i(1)=q_i$, and $\gamma_i(t)\ne \gamma_j(t)$ if $i\ne j$.

Choose a smooth vector field $\vec v_t$ such that $\vec v_t(\gamma_i(t))=\gamma'_i(t)$ for any $i$ and $t$.
We can assume in addition that $\vec v_t$ vanish outside of a sufficiently large disc; it can be arranged by a multiplying the vector field to a function 
$\sigma_1(R-|x|)$; see page \pageref{page:sigma-function}.

It remains to apply the Moser trick to the constructed vector field.

Without loss of generality we can assume that the origin belongs to both $\Sigma$ and $\Theta$.

In each case show that there is a vector field $\vec v$ defined on $\RR^2\backslash\{0\}$ that flows $\Sigma$ to $\Theta$.
In fact one can choose radial fields of that type,
but be careful with with the cases \ref{SHORT.ex:star-shaped-disc:nonsmooth} and \ref{SHORT.ex:star-shaped-disc:star-shaped} --- they are not as easy.

Assume a neighborhood of $p$ in $\Sigma$ is a graph $z=f(x,y)$.
In this case $s\:(u,v)\mapsto (u,v,f(u,v))$ is a smooth chart at $p$.
Show that the plane spanned by $s_u$ and $s_v$ is not vertical;
together with \ref{def:tangent-plane} it proves the if part.

For the only-if part, fix a chart

Fix a point $p$ on $\gamma$.
Since $\Sigma$ is mirror symmetric with respect to $\Pi$,
so is the tangent plane $\T_p$.

Choose $(x,y)$-coordinates on $\T_p$ so that the $x$-axis is the intersection $\Pi\cap  \T_p$.
Suppose that the osculating paraboloid is described by the graph 
\[z=\tfrac12\cdot(\ell\cdot x^2+2\cdot m\cdot x\cdot y+n\cdot y^2)\]
Since $\Sigma$ is mirror symmetric, so is the paraboloid;
that is, changing $y$ to $(-y)$ does not change the value 
$\ell\cdot x^2+2\cdot m\cdot x\cdot y+n\cdot y^2$.
In other words $m=0$, or equivalently, the $x$-axis points in the direction of curvature.

We can assume that $\gamma$ is parameterized by its arc-length.
Denote by $\Norm_1(s)$ and $\Norm_2(s)$ the unit normal vectors to $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ at $\gamma(s)$.
Since $\gamma$ is a curvature line in $\Sigma_1$, we have 
$\Norm_1'$ is proportional to $\gamma'$;
in particular 
\[\langle\Norm_1',\Norm_2\rangle=0.\]

Note that $\langle \Norm_1(t),\Norm_2(t)\rangle$ is constant.
By taking its derivative and applying the above identity show that
\[\langle\Norm_1,\Norm_2'\rangle=0.\]
Conclude that $\Norm_2'$ is proportional to $\gamma'$

\parbf{\ref{ex:area-ball-intersection}.}
By \ref{lem:reg-section}, varying $r$ slightly, we can assume that $\Sigma$ intersects the sphere $S(p,r)$ along a finite collection of closed curves.

These curves bound a domain $D$ with area at most $2\cdot \pi\cdot r^2$.
Assume $D$ is connected.
Since $\Sigma$ is area minimizing the area of $\Delta$ cannot be smaller than the area of $\Sigma\cap B(p,r)$;
whence the result.

If $D$ is not connected, then
it can be made connected by attaching tiny tubes between its connected components.
The extra area of these tubes can be made smaller than any given $\eps>0$.
Therefore we get 
\[\area[\Sigma\cap B(p,r)]\le 2\cdot \pi\cdot r^2+\eps.\]
The statement follows since $\eps>0$ is arbitrary.

Show that if $R$ is large, the area of this region is at least $\pi\cdot R^2$ --- the area of disc of radius $R$.

Observe that the lateral surface of cylinder bounded by the two circles is $4\cdot \pi\cdot R\cdot r$.
Since $r/R\to 0$ as $R\to \infty$, we get that this surface has smaller area then region of catenoid.

It follows that if $\gamma$ is a connected component of the intersection $\Pi\cap\Sigma$ that is not an isolated point,
then at each point $p$ on $\gamma$ the tangent plane $\T_p\Sigma$ is transversal to $\Pi$.
Apply the implicit function theorem to show that $\gamma$ is a smooth regular curve.

Finally, observe that curvature of $\gamma$ can not be smaller than normal curvature of $\Sigma$ in the same direction.
Whence $\gamma$ has no points with vanishing curvature.
Therefore for a right choice of orientation of $\gamma$, we its signed curvature is positive.

\parit{Remark.}
In fact if Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is at least $1$,
then
the intrinsic diameter of $\Sigma$ can not exceed $\pi$.
The latter means that any two points in $\Sigma$ can be connected by a path that lies in $\Sigma$ and has length at most~$\pi$.

To prove \ref{SHORT.ex:convex-proper-sphere:single} use convexity of $R$.
To prove \ref{SHORT.ex:convex-proper-sphere:smooth} observe that the map $\Sigma\to\mathbb{S}^2$ is smooth and regular, then apply the inverse function theorem to show that inverse is smooth as well.



\parbf{\ref{ex:convex-proper-plane}.}
We can assume that the origin lies on $\Sigma$.
Consider a sequence of points $x_n\in \Sigma$ such that $|x_n|\z\to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$.
Set $u_n=\tfrac{x_n}{|x_n|}$; this is the unit vector in the direction from $x_n$.
Since the unit sphere is compact, we can pass to a subsequence of $(x_n)$ such that $u_n$ converges to a unit vector $u$.
Show that the half-line from the origin in the direction of $u$ can be taken as $\ell$; that will solve \ref{SHORT.ex:convex-proper-plane:a}.

To solve \ref{SHORT.ex:convex-proper-plane:b},
Note and use that for any $q\in \Sigma$, the directions $v_n=\tfrac{x_n-q}{|x_n-q|}$ converge to $u$ as well.

Since $R$ is convex, so its projection $\Omega$.
Show that $\Sigma$ has no vertical tangent planes;
therefore projection $\Omega$ of $\Sigma$ to $(x,y)$-plane is regular.
Use the inverse function theorem to show that $\Omega$ is open; hence \ref{SHORT.ex:convex-proper-plane:b}.

\parbf{\ref{ex:open+convex=plane}.}
By \ref{ex:convex-proper-plane:d}, $\Sigma$ is parameterized by an open convex plane domain $\Omega$.
It remains to show that $\Omega$ can parameterize the whole plane.

We may assume that the origin of the plane leis in $\Omega$.
Show that in this case the boundary of $\Omega$ can be written in polar coordinates as $(\theta,f(\theta))$ where $f\:\mathbb{S}^1\to\RR$ is a positive continuous function.
Then homeomorphism to the plane can be described in polar coordinate by changing only the radial coordinate;
for example as 
$(\theta,r)\mapsto (\theta,
\tfrac1{f(\theta)-r}-\tfrac1{f(\theta)})$.

we may assume that $\eps$ is small, say $\eps<1$.

It follows that $\Norm\:\Sigma\to\mathbb{S}^2$ is bijection.

Applying \ref{cor:intK}, we get that

Use the definition of saddle surface to show for any point $x\in\Sigma$ there is an arc $\gamma\:[0,1]\to\Sigma$ that starts from $x$ such that 
the function $f\:t\mapsto |p-\gamma(t)|$ is monotonically increasing and $f(1)>f(0)+\eps(x)$ for some $\eps(x)>0$.
(In fact such a curve can be choosen among graphs over line segments in the tangent-normal coordinates at $x$.)

Further, show that the function $x\mapsto\eps(x)$ can be assumed to be continuous.
Conclude that for any $R$ there is $\eps>0$ such that $\eps(x)>\eps$ for any $x\in\Sigma\cap B(p,R)$.

Now construct the needed curve as an infinite concatenation of the deacribed arcs.
Observe that the described property guranees that it will escape from any ball in finite number of steps.

\parbf{\ref{ex:panov}.} Denote by $\Pi_t$ the tangent plane to $\Sigma$ at $\gamma(t)$ and by $\ell_t$ the tangent line of $\gamma$ at time $t$.

Since $\gamma$ is asymptotic, the plane $\Pi_t$ rotates around $\ell_t$ as $t$ changes.
Since $\Sigma$ is saddle, the speed of rotation cannot vanish.%
\footnote{In fact by the Beltrami--Enneper theorem, if $\gamma$ has unit speed, then the speed of rotation is $\pm\sqrt{-K}$, where $K$ is the Gauss curvature which cannot vanish on a saddle surface.}

Note that $\Pi_t$ is a graph of a linear function, say $h_t$, defined on the $(x, y)$-plane.
Denote by $\bar\ell_t$ the projection of $\ell_t$ to the $(x, y)$-plane.
The described rotation of $\Pi_t$ can be expressed algebraicaly:
the derivative $\tfrac{d}{dt}h_t(w)$ vanishes at the point $w$ if and only if $w\in \bar\ell_t$ 
and the derivative changes sign if $w$ changes the side of $\bar\ell_t$.

Denote by $\bar\gamma$ the projection of $\gamma$ to the $(x, y)$-plane.
If $\bar\gamma$ is star shaped with respect to a point $w$, then $w$ cannot cross $\bar\ell_t$.
Therefore the function $t\mapsto h_t(w)$ is monotone on $\mathbb{S}^1$.
Observing that this function cannot be constant, we arrive to a contradiction.

\parit{Soruse:} The problem is discuss by Dmitri Panov \cite{panov-curves}.

\parbf{\ref{ex:crosss}.}
This problem follows easily from the so called \index{Morse lemma}\emph{Morse lemma}.
The following sketch is a slightly stripped version of it.
A more instructive proof can be built using the Moser's trick \cite{palais}.

\medskip

Choose a tangent-normal coordinates at $p$ so that the axis point in the principle directions of $\Sigma$ at $p$;
let $z=f(x,y)$ be the local graph representation of $\Sigma$.
We need to show that the solution of equation $f(x,y)=0$ is a union of two smooth curves that intersect transversely at $p$.

Prove the following claim:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Suppose that  $x\mapsto h(x)$ is a smooth function defined in an open interval $\mathbb{I}\ni0$ such that $h(0)=h'(0)=0$ and $h''(0)>0$.
 Then, for a smaller interval $\mathbb{J}\ni0$ there is a unique smooth function $a\:\mathbb{J}\to\RR$ such that $h=a^2$, $a(0)=0$ and $a'(0)> 0$.
\end{itemize}
Note that by passing to a small rectangular domain $|x|,|y|<\eps$, we can assume that $f_{xx}>\eps$ and $f_{yy}<-\eps$. 
Show that if $\eps$ is small, then for every $x$ there is unique $y(x)$ such that $f_x(x,y(x))=0$; 
moreover the function $x\mapsto y(x)$ is smooth.

Set $h(x)=f(x,y(x))$.
Note that $h(0)=h'(0)=0$ and $h''>0$.
Applying the claim, we get a function $a$ such that that $h=a^2$, where $a(0)=0$ and $a'(0)>0$.

Observe that $g(x,y)=h(x)-f(x,y)\ge 0$ and $g_y(x,y(x))\z=g(x,y(x))\z=0$ and $g_{yy}>0$.
Applying the claim for each functions $y\mapsto g(x,y)$ with fixed $x$, we get that $g(x,y)=b(x,y)^2$ for a smooth function $b$ such that 
$b(x,y(x))=0$ and $b_y(x,y(x))>0$.

It follows that 
\begin{align*}
f(x,y)&=a(x)^2-b(x,y)^2-=
\\
&=(a(x)-b(x,y))\cdot (a(x)+b(x,y)).
\end{align*}
That is $f(x,y)=0$ if $a(x)\pm b(x,y) =0$.

It remains to observe that the two functions $g_\pm(x,y)=a(x)\pm b(x,y)$ have distinct non-zero gradients at $0$ and apply the implicit function theorem.
Therefore each equation $a(x)\pm b(x,y) =0$ defines a smooth regular curve in a neighborhood of $p$.





\parbf{\ref{ex:length-of-bry}.} Use \ref{lem:convex-saddle} and the hemisphere lemma (\ref{lem:hemisphere}).

\parbf{\ref{ex:circular-cone-saddle}.}
Assume $\Sigma$ is an open saddle surface that lies in a cone $K$.
Show that there is a plane $\Pi$ that cuts $\Sigma$ and cuts from $K$ a compact region.
Observe that $\Pi$ cuts from $\Sigma$ a compact region.

By \ref{lem:reg-section} one can move plane $\Pi$ slightly so that it cuts from $\Sigma$ a compact surface with boundary.
Apply \ref{lem:convex-saddle}.


\parbf{\ref{ex:disc-hat}.} Observe that it is sufficient to construct a smooth parametrization of $F_\eps$ by a closed hemisphere.

Consider the radial projection of $F_\eps$ to the sphere $\Sigma$ with the center at $p=(0,0,\eps)$;
that is, a point $q\in F_\eps$ is mapped to a point $s(q)$ on the sphere that lies on the ray $pq$.

Show that $s$ is a diffeomorphism from $F_\eps$ to a south hemisphere of~$\Sigma$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:saddle-linear}.} Apply \ref{prop:hat}.

\parbf{\ref{ex:saddle-intersection};} \ref{SHORT.ex:saddle-intersection:graph}.
Choose $p\in\Gamma$.

If $\T_p\nparallel\Pi$, then implicit function theorem implies that a neighborhood of $p$ in $\Gamma$ admits a smooth parameterization by an real interval.

If  $\T_p\parallel\Pi$, then \ref{ex:crosss} implies that $p$ is a cross point of two smooth curves in $\Gamma$.

It follows that $\Gamma$ is a smooth graph and every vertex of $\Gamma$ in the interior of $\Delta$ has degree $4$.
No cycle condition follows from Jordan's theorem \ref{thm:jordan} and \ref{lem:convex-saddle}.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:saddle-intersection:graphik}.} Show that if $\Sigma$ is not a graph, then it has a vertical tangent $\T_p$ plane at some point $p$.
Apply part \ref{SHORT.ex:saddle-intersection:graph} for the intersection of $\Sigma$ with $\T_p$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:one-side-bernshtein}.} Look at the sections of the graph by planes parallel to the $(x,y)$-plane and to the $(x,z)$-plane, then apply Meusnier’s theorem (\ref{thm:meusnier}).

Suppose that orthogonal projection of $\Sigma$ to the $(x,y)$-plane is not injective.
Show that there is a point $p\in\Sigma$ with vertical tangent plane;
that is, $\T_p\Sigma$ is perpendicular to the $(x,y)$-plane.

Let $\Gamma_p$ be the connected component of $p$ in the intersection of $\Sigma$ and $\T_p$.
Show that (1) $\Gamma_p$ is a tree, (2) each vertex of $\Gamma_p$ has degree 4 or 1, (3) $p$ is a vertex of degree 4, and (4) each endvertex lies on the bounary of $\Sigma$.

Observe that $\T_p$ meets the boundary of $\Sigma$ at two points,
therefore $\Gamma$ has 2 endpoints.
Use it to get a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{ex:length-dist}.} 
Note that by \ref{thm:convex-embedded}, $\Sigma$ bounds a strictly convex region.
Therefore we can assume that $\Norm(p)\ne\Norm(q)$, otherwise $p=q$ and the inequality is evident.

Further, we can assume that $\Norm(p)+\Norm(q)\ne 0$, otherwise the right hand side is undefined.


In the remaining case the tangent planes $\T_p$ and $\T_q$ intersect along a line, say $\ell$.
Set $\alpha=\tfrac12\cdot\measuredangle(\Norm(p),\Norm(q))$;
observe that $\cos\alpha= |\Norm(p)+\Norm(q)|/2$.
Let $x\in \ell$ be the point that minimize the sum $|p-x|\z+|x-q|$.
Observe that $\measuredangle\hinge xpq\ge \pi-2\cdot\alpha$.
Conclude that 
\[|p-x|+|x-q|\le \frac{|p-q|}{\cos\alpha}.\]

Finally, apply \ref{cor:shorts+convex} to show that
\[|p-q|_\Sigma\le |p-x|+|x-q|.\]


\parbf{\ref{ex:hat-convex}.} Assume the contrary,
then there is a minimizing geodesic $\gamma\not\subset\Delta$ with ends $p$ and $q$ in $\Delta$.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that only one arc of $\gamma$ lies outside of $\Delta$.
Reflection of this arc  with respect to $\Pi$ together with the remaining part of $\gamma$ forms another curve $\hat\gamma$ from $p$ to $q$;
it runs partly along $\Sigma$ 
and partly outside $\Sigma$,
but does not get inside $\Sigma$.
Note that
\[\length\hat\gamma=\length\gamma.\]


Denote by $\bar\gamma$ the closest point projection of $\hat\gamma$ on $\Sigma$.
Note that the curve $\bar\gamma$ lies in $\Sigma$, 
it has the same ends as $\gamma$,
and by \ref{cor:shorts+convex}
\[\length\bar\gamma<\length\gamma.\]
This means that $\gamma$ is not length minimizing, 
a contradiction.

Show that $\Norm_{\gamma(t)}=(\cos t,\sin t, 0)$.
Calculate $\gamma''(t)$ and show that it is proportional to $\Norm_{\gamma(t)}$.
Note that the latter is equivalent to $\gamma''(t)\perp\T_{\gamma(t)}$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:asymptotic-geodesic}.} Without loss of generality, we can assume that $\gamma$ has unit speed.
By the definition of geodesic, we have that $\gamma''(s)\perp\T_{\gamma(s)}$. 
Therefore 
\[\gamma''(s)=k_n(s)\cdot\Norm_{\gamma(s)},\]
where $k_n(s)$ is the normal curvature of $\gamma$ at time $s$.
Since $\gamma$ is asymptotic, $k_n(s)\equiv 0$;
that is, $\gamma''(s)\equiv 0$, therefore $\gamma'$ is constant and $\gamma$ runs along a line segment.

\parbf{\ref{ex:reflection-geodesic}.}
Denote by $\mu$ a unit vector perpendicular to $\Pi$.
Since $\gamma$ lies in $\Pi$, we have that $\gamma''$ is parallel to $\Pi$, or equivalently $\gamma''\perp \mu$.
Since $\gamma$ is unit speed, \ref{prop:a'-pertp-a''} implies that $\gamma''\perp\gamma'$.

Since $\Sigma$ is mirror symmetric with respect to  a plane $\Pi$,
the tangent palne $\T_{\gamma(t)}\Sigma$ is also mirror symmetric with respect to  a plane $\Pi$.
It follows that $\T_{\gamma(t)}\Sigma$ is spanned by $\mu$ and $\gamma'(t)$.
Therefore $\gamma''\perp \mu$ and $\gamma''\perp\gamma'$ imply $\gamma''\perp\T_{\gamma(t)}\Sigma$;
that is, $\gamma$ is a geodesic.

\parbf{\ref{ex:round-torus}.}
By \ref{ex:reflection-geodesic}, any meridian of $\Sigma$ is a closed geodesic.
Consider an arbitrary closed geodesic $\gamma$.

Note that if $\gamma$ is tangent to a meridian at some point, then by uniqueness, $\gamma$ runs along the meridian; in particular it is non-contractible.

It remains to consider the case when $\gamma$ intersect meridians transitively. So the longitude of $\gamma$ is monotone.
Whence again $\gamma$ is non-contractible.

\parbf{\ref{ex:two-min-geod}.}
Assume that two shortest paths $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have two common point $p$ and $q$.
Denote by $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_1$ the arcs of

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{38 mm}

Note that $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_1$ are shorest paths with the same endpoints;
in particular they have the same length.
Exchanging $\alpha_1$ in $\alpha$ to $\beta_1$ produces a shortest path, say $\hat\alpha$, that is distinct from $\alpha$.
By \ref{prop:gamma''}, $\hat\alpha$ is a geodesic.

Suppose $\alpha_1$ is a proper subarc of $\alpha$;
that is, if $\alpha_1\ne\alpha$, or, equivalently, either $p$ or $q$ is not an endpoint of $\alpha$.
Then $\alpha$ and $\hat\alpha$ share one point and velocity vector at this point.
By \ref{prop:geod-existence} $\alpha$ coincides with $\hat\alpha$ --- a contradiction.

It follows that $p$ and $q$ are the end points of $\alpha$.
The same way we can show that $p$ and $q$ are the end points of $\beta$.

Assume a shortest path $\alpha$ changes the sides of $\Pi$ at least twice.
In this case there is an arc $\alpha_1$ of $\alpha$ that lies on one side on $\Pi$ and has ends on $\Pi$ and these ends are distinct from the ends of $\alpha$.

Let us remove the arc $\alpha_1$ from $\alpha$ and exchange it to the reflection of $\alpha_1$ across $\Pi$.
Note that the obtained curve, say $\beta$, lies in the surface; it has the same length as $\alpha$, and it connects the same pair of points, say $p$ and $q$.
Therefore $\beta$ is another shortest path from $p$ to $q$ that is distinct from $\alpha$.

By \ref{prop:gamma''}, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are geodesics.
Since $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have a common subarc, they share one point and velocity vector at this point;
by \ref{prop:geod-existence} $\alpha$ coinsides with $\beta$ --- a contradiction.

Equip $\Sigma$ with unit normal field $\Norm$ that points inside.
Denote by $k(t)$ the normal curvature of $\Sigma$ at $\gamma(t)$ in the direction of $\gamma'(t)$.
Since $\Sigma$ is convex $k(t)\ge 0$ for any $t$.

Since $\gamma$ is geodesic, we have $\gamma''(t)=k(t)\cdot\Norm_{\gamma(t)}$.

Since $\gamma$ has unit speed, $\langle\gamma'(t),\gamma'(t)\rangle=1$ for any $t$.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that $p$ is the origin of~$\RR^3$.
Since $p$ is inside $\Sigma$, we have that $\langle\gamma(t),\Norm_{\gamma(t)}\rangle\le 0$ for any $t$.
It follows that 
\[\langle\gamma''(t),\gamma(t)\rangle=k(t)\cdot \langle\gamma(t),\Norm_{\gamma(t)}\rangle\le 0\]
for any $t$.

Applying the above estimates, we get that 
\begin{align*}
\rho''(t)
&=\langle\gamma(t),\gamma(t)\rangle''=

Suppose $\tan(t),\mu(t),\Norm(t)$ is the frame as in the definition of geodesic curvature.

If $\gamma$ is a geodesic, then by \ref{lem:constant-speed}, it has constant speed.
Applying scaling, we may assume that the speed is 1.
In this case 
\[\gamma''(t)=k_g(t)\cdot \mu(t)-k_n(t)\cdot \Norm(t).\]
Since $\gamma''(t)\perp\T_{\gamma(t)}$ we get that $k_g=0$. 
That proves the ``only if'' part.

Now assume that $\gamma$ has constant speed.
Againg, applying scaling, we may assume that the speed is 1.
In this case 
\[\gamma''(t)=-k_n(t)\cdot \Norm(t).\]
Therefore $\gamma''(t)\perp\T_{\gamma(t)}$.

Similarly $\gamma_1$ lies in one of the regions, say $R_2$, that $\gamma_2$ cuts  from $\Sigma$.

Apply the Gauss--Bonnet formula (\ref{thm:gb}) to show that the loops surround regions with integral of Gauss curvature $\pi+\alpha$, $\pi+\beta$, and $\pi+\gamma$ respectively.

Apply the Gauss--Bonnet formula for the triangular region to show that $\alpha+\beta+\gamma>\pi$.
It follows that 
\[\iint_\Sigma K>(\pi+\alpha)+(\pi+\beta)+(\pi+\gamma)>4\cdot\pi\]
which contradicts \ref{ex:intK:4pi}.

Observe that $|p-x|_\Sigma\le |p-q|_\Sigma$ and $|q-x|_\Sigma\le |p-q|_\Sigma$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:midpoints}.} Use \ref{angk>angk} or \ref{angk<angk} twice:
first for the triangle $[pxy]$ and $\bar x\in [px]$
and 
second for the triangle $[p\bar xy]$ and $\bar y\in [py]$.
Then apply the angle monotonicity (\ref{lem:angle-monotonicity}).

\parbf{\ref{ex:open-comparison}.} To prove \ref{SHORT.ex:open-comparison:positive}, apply Rauch comparison \ref{prop:rauch} and the property of exponential map in \ref{prop:exp}.

For \ref{SHORT.ex:open-comparison:almost-min}, argue by contradiction;
if the statement does not hold then for any $p\in\Sigma$ there is a point $q=q(p)\in \Sigma$ such that 
\[
q(p)\in B(p,100\cdot R_p)
\quad\text{and}\quad
R_{q(p)}<(1-\tfrac1{100})\cdot R_p.
\]

Start with any point $p_0$ and consider a sequence $p_n$ defined by $p_{n+1}\z=q(p_n)$.
Show that $p_n$ converges and $R_{p_n}\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$.
Arrive to a contradiction using  \ref{SHORT.ex:open-comparison:positive}.

For \ref{SHORT.ex:open-comparison:proof}, repeat the proof assuming that $p$ is provided by \ref{SHORT.ex:open-comparison:almost-min}.

Consider the pentagon $\Delta$ with induced length-metric.
Note that all its angles cannot exceed $\pi$.
Repeat the proof of \ref{thm:comp:toponogov} to show that the comparison holds in $\Delta$.

Now choose a vertex $v$ of $\Delta$, subdivide its sides so that each arc of the subdivision is a minimizing geodesic, so the boundary of $\Delta$ is a broken geodesic.
Divide $\Delta$ into triangles by joining $v$ to other vertexes of the broken geodesic.
Take a model triangle for each so that they share sides as in $\Delta$.
Use the comparison to show that these plane triangles form a required polygon.

\parit{\ref{SHORT.ex:self-intersections-hard}}.
It remains to show that the plane pentagon provided by \ref{SHORT.ex:convex-polyhon} cannot exist.
Imagine that there air pressure in the pentagon, it should not move it; so the total force should vanish.
Use part \ref{SHORT.ex:convex-polyhon+self-intersections:angles} to show that this is not the case.

Suppose $\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic in $\Delta$ and $\gamma(0)=p$. 
Denote by $q$ a point on $\delta$ that minimize the distance to $p$.
Denote by $\phi$ the angle between $\gamma$ and $[pq]$ at $p$.
Note that it is sufficient to show that 
\[f\circ\gamma(t)\le |p-q|_\Sigma+t\cdot\cos\phi\eqlbl{eq:dist<cosphi}\]
for $t$ sufficiently close to $0$.

Chose small $t>0$ and set $x\z=\gamma(t)$.
Consider a model triangle $[\tilde p\tilde q\tilde x]\z=\tilde\triangle(pqx)$.
Let $\tilde\delta$ be the line thru $\tilde q$ perpendicular to $[\tilde p\tilde q]$.
Denote by $\tilde y$ the orthogonal projection of $\tilde x$ to $\tilde\delta$.

By comparison we have that 
\begin{align*}
\phi
&\df\measuredangle\hinge qpx
\ge \angk qpx
\mathrel{=:}\tilde\phi
\\
\psi&\df
\measuredangle\hinge pqx
\ge 
\angk pqx
\mathrel{=:}\tilde \psi
\end{align*}


Since $t=|\tilde p-\tilde x|_{\RR^2}$ is small, so is the distances $|\tilde q-\tilde y|_{\RR^2}$.
Therefore we can choose a point $y$ on $\delta$ such that $|q-y|_\Sigma=|\tilde q-\tilde y|_{\RR^2}$;
moreover we can assume that $y$ is chosen so that we have $\measuredangle\hinge qxy= \tfrac\pi2-\psi$.



By construction and comparison, we have 
\begin{align*}
\measuredangle\hinge {\tilde q}{\tilde x}{\tilde y}&=\tfrac\pi2-\tilde\psi
\ge
\\
&\ge
\tfrac\pi2-\psi
=
\\
&=
\measuredangle\hinge q x y
\ge 
\\
&\ge \angk q x y.
\end{align*}
Therefore $|x-y|_\Sigma\le |\tilde x-\tilde y|_{\RR}$.
Since $\tilde\phi\le\phi$, we get that
\begin{align*}
f\circ\gamma(t)&\le |x-y|_\Sigma\le 
\\
&\le|\tilde x-\tilde y|_{\RR}=
\\
&=|p-q|_\Sigma+t\cdot\cos\tilde\phi
\le
\\
&\le|p-q|_\Sigma+t\cdot\cos\phi.
\end{align*}
That is, we proved \ref{eq:dist<cosphi} for small $t>0$.
The case $t<0$ can be done along the same lines.

It is sufficient to prove the Jensen inequality;
that is, 
\[
\dist{\gamma_1(\tfrac12)}{\gamma_2(\tfrac12)}{}
\le
\tfrac12\cdot\dist{\gamma_1(0)}{\gamma_2(0)}{}
+
\tfrac12\cdot \dist{\gamma_1(1)}{\gamma_2(1)}{}.
\]

Let $\delta$ be the geodesic path from $\gamma_2(0)$ to $\gamma_1(1)$.
From \ref{ex:midpoints}, we have
\begin{align*}
\dist{\gamma_1(\tfrac12)}{\delta(\tfrac12)}{}
&\le
\tfrac12\cdot\dist{\gamma_1(0)}{\delta(0)}{}
\\
\dist{\delta(\tfrac12)}{\gamma_2(\tfrac12)}{}
&\le
\tfrac12\cdot\dist{\delta(1)}{\gamma_2(1)}{}
\end{align*}
It remains to sum it up and apply the triangle inequality.

\parit{Remark.} Note that modulo the comparison theorem 
on the Euclidean plane the proof is just as hard.

Choose two points $x,z\in\Sigma$;
let $y$ be the midpoint of $[xz]$.
It is sufficient to show that 
\[f(y)\le \tfrac12(f(x)+f(z)).\]

Denote by $\bar x$ and $\bar z$ the points on $\delta$ that minimize the distances to $x$ and $z$ respectively;
so we have
\begin{align*}
f(x)
&=|x-\bar x|_\Sigma,
&
f(z)
&=|z-\bar z|_\Sigma.
\end{align*}

By \ref{ex:unique-geod}, $[\bar x\bar z]$ is an arc of $\delta$.
Therefore the midpoint of $[\bar x\bar z]$, say  $\bar y$, lies on $\delta$.

By \ref{ex:dist-to-bry}, we have 
\begin{align*}
f(y)&\le |y-\bar y|_\Sigma\le
\\
&\le\tfrac12\cdot(|x-\bar x|_\Sigma
+
|z-\bar z|_\Sigma)=
\\
&=\tfrac12\cdot(f(x)+f(z))
