Let $\alpha$ be a path connecting $p$ to $q$.

Passing to a subinterval if necessary,
we can assume that $\alpha(t)\ne p,q$ for $t\ne0,1$.

An open set $\Omega$ in $(0,1)$ will be called {}\emph{suitable}
if for any connected component $(a,b)$ of $\Omega$ we have $\alpha(a)=\alpha(b)$.
Show that the union of nested suitable sets is suitable.
Therefore we can find a maximal suitable set $\hat \Omega$.

Define $\beta(t)=\alpha(a)$ for any $t$ in a connected component $(a,b)\subset\Omega$.
Note that for any $x\in [0,1]$ the set $\beta^{-1}\{\beta(x)\}$ is connected.

It remains to re-parametrize $\beta$ to make it injective.
In other words we need to construct a non-decreasing surjective function $\tau\:[0,1]\z\to[0,1]$ such that 
$\tau(t_1)=\tau(t_2)$ if and only if there is a connected component $(a,b)$ such that $t_1,t_2\z\in [a,b]$.
The construction is similar to the construction of devil's staircase.


\parbf{\ref{ex:L-shape}.}
Denote the union of two half-axis by $L$.
Observe that $f(t)\to\infty$ as $t\to \infty$.
Since $f(0)=0$, the intermediate value theorem implies that $f(t)$ takes all nonnegative values for $t\ge 0$.
Use it to show that $L$ is the range of $\alpha$.

Note that the function $f$
is smooth.
Indeed, the existence of all derivatives $f^{(n)}(x)$ at $x\ne 0$ is evident and direct calculations show that $f^{(n)}(0)=0$ for all $n$.
Therefore $t\mapsto \alpha(t)=(f(t),f(-t))$ is smooth as well.

Further, show that the function $f$ is strictly increasing for $t> 0$,
and, moreover, if $0<t_0<t_1$, then $0<f(t_0)<f(t_1)$.
Use it to show that the maps $t\mapsto \alpha(t)$ is injective.

Summarizing we get that $\alpha$ is a smooth parametrization of $L$. 

Now suppose $\beta\:t\mapsto (x(t),y(t))$ is a smooth parameterization of~$L$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that $x(0)=y(0)=0$.
Note that $x(t)\ge 0$ for any $t$ therefore $x'(0)=0$.
The same way we get that $y'(0)=0$.
That is, $\beta'(0)=0$;
so $L$ does not admit a smooth regular parameterization.

\parbf{\ref{ex:cycloid}.}
Apply the definitions.
For \ref{SHORT.ex:cycloid:regular} you need to check that $\gamma'_\ell\ne 0$.
For \ref{SHORT.ex:cycloid:simple} you need to check that $\gamma_\ell(t_0)=\gamma(t_1)$ only if $t_0=t_1$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:viviani}.}
For $\ell=0$ the system describes a pair of points $(0,0,\pm1)$, so we can assume that $\ell\ne 0$.
Note that first equation desribes the unit sphere centered at the origin
and the second equation describes a cylinder over the circle in the $(x,y)$-plane with diameter with opposite points $(0,0)$ and $(0,\ell)$.


For $\ell\ne 0$,
find the gradients $\nabla f$ and $\nabla h$ for the functions
\begin{align*}
 f(x,y,z)&=x^2+y^2+z^2-1
 \\
 h(x,y,z)&=x^2+\ell\cdot x+y^2
\end{align*}
and show that they are linearly dependent only on the $x$-axis.
Conclude that for $\ell\ne\pm 1$ each connected component of the set of solutions is a smooth regular curve.

Show that 
\begin{itemize}
\item if $|\ell|<1$, then the set has two connected components with $z>0$ and $z<0$.
\item if $|\ell|\ge1$, then the set is connected.
\end{itemize}

Note that the condition on gradients provides only sufficient condition.
Therefore he case $\ell=\pm1$ has to be checked by hands.
In this case a neighborhood of $(\pm1,0,0)$ does not admit a smooth regular parametrization --- try to prove it. %???+PIC

\parit{Remark.}
In the case $\ell=\pm1$ it is called \emph{Viviani's curve}.
It admits the following smooth regular parameterization with a self-intersection:
\[t\mapsto(\pm(\cos t)^2,\cos t\cdot\sin t,\sin t).\]


\parbf{\ref{ex:proper-curve}.}
Without loss of generality we may assume that the origin does not lie on the curve.

Show that inversion of the plane $(x,y)\mapsto (\tfrac{x}{x^2+y^2},\tfrac{y}{x^2+y^2})$ maps our curve maps to a closed curve with removed origin.
Apply Jordan's theorem for the obtained curve and use the inversion again.

\parbf{\ref{ex:integral-length-0}.} Observe that if $c=\tau_0<\dots<\tau_n=d$ is a partition of $[c,d]$ if and only if $t_i=\phi(\tau_i)$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ and apply the definition of length (\ref{def:length}).

\parbf{\ref{ex:length-image}.}
Fix a partition $0=t_0<\dots <t_n=1$ of $[0,1]$.
Set $\tau_0=0$ and $\tau_i=\max\set{\tau \in[0,1]}{\beta(\tau_i)=\alpha(t_i)}$.
Show that $(\tau_i)$ is a partition of $[0,1]$;
that is, $0=\tau_0<\tau_1<\dots<\tau_n=1$.

By construction 
\begin{align*}
|\alpha(t_0)&-\alpha(t_1)|+|\alpha(t_1)-\alpha(t_2)|+\dots+|\alpha(t_{n-1})-\alpha(t_n)|=
\\
&=
|\beta(\tau_0)-\beta(\tau_1)|+|\beta(\tau_1)-\beta(\tau_2)|+\dots+|\beta(\tau_{n-1})-\beta(\tau_n)|.
\end{align*}
Since the partition $(t_i)$ is arbitrary, we get 
\[\length \beta\ge \length \alpha.\]

\parit{Remark.}
Note that the partition $(\tau_i)$ is not arbitrary, therefore the inequality might be strict; it might happen if $\beta$ runs back and forth along $\alpha$.

We have to assume that $a\ne 0$ or $b\ne0$;
otherwise we get a constant curve.

Show that the curve has constant velocity $|\gamma'(t)|\equiv \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.
Therefore 
\[s=\tfrac{t}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}\] is an arc-length parameter.


\parbf{\ref{ex:convex-hull}.}
Choose a closed polygonal line $p_1\dots p_n$ inscribed in $\beta$.
By \ref{cor:convex=>rectifiable}, we can assume that it length is arbitrary close to the length of $\beta$;
that is, given $\eps>0$ 
\[\length (p_1\dots p_n)>\length\beta-\eps.\]

Show that we may assume in addition that each point $p_i$ lies on $\alpha$.

Observe that since $\alpha$ is simple, the points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ appear on $\alpha$ in the same cyclic order;
that is, the polygonal line $p_1\dots p_n$ is also inscribed in $\alpha$.
In particular 
\[\length\alpha\ge \length (p_1\dots p_n).\]
It follows that 
\[\length\alpha>\length\beta-\eps.\]
for any $\eps>0$.
Whence 
\[\length\alpha\ge\length\beta.\]

%???+PIC
If $\alpha$ has self-intersections, then the points $p_1,\dots, p_n$ might appear on $\alpha$ in a different order, say $p_{i_1},\dots,p_{i_n}$.
Apply triangle inequality to show that 
\[\length(p_{i_1}\dots p_{i_n})\ge \length (p_1\dots p_n)\]
and use it to modify the proof above.

\parbf{\ref{ex:convex-croftons}.} 
Denote by $\ell_u$ the line segment 
obtained orthogonal projection of $\gamma$ to the line in the direction $u$.
Note that $\gamma_u$ runs back and forth along $\ell_u$, we get 
\[\length\gamma_u\ge 2\cdot\length\ell_u.\]
Applying the Crofton formula, we get that 
\[\length\gamma\ge \pi \overline{\length\ell_u}.\]

In the case of equality, the curve $\gamma_u$ runs exactly back and forth along $\ell_u$ without additional zigzags for almost all (and therefore for all) $u$.

Let $K$ be a closed set bounded by $\gamma$.
Observe that the last statement implies that every line may intersect $K$ only along a closed segment.
In other words $K$ is convex.

\parbf{\ref{adex:more-croftons}.}
The proof is identical to the proof of the standard Crofton formula.
To find the coefficient one has to find average length of projection of unit vector to a line.
Which can be done by integration.
\begin{align*}
\frac1{k_a}&=\frac{1}{\area \SS^2}\cdot\int_{\SS^2} |x|;
&
\frac1{k_b}&=\frac{1}{\area \SS^2}\cdot\int_{\SS^2} \sqrt{1-x^2}.
\end{align*}
The answers are $k_a=2$ and $k_b=\tfrac4\pi$.

\parbf{\ref{ex-def:length-metric}.}

The ``only-if'' part is trivial.
To show the ``if'' part, assume $A$ is not convex;
that is, there are points $x,y\in A$ and a point $z\notin A$ that lies between $x$ and $y$.

Since $A$ is closed, its complement is open.
That is, the ball $B(z,\eps)$ does not intersect $A$ for some $\eps>0$.

Show that there is $\delta>0$ such that any path of length at most $|z-y|_{\RR^3}+\delta$ pass thru $B(z,\eps)$.
It follows that $|z-y|_A\ge |z-y|_{\RR^3}+\delta$, 
in particular$|z-y|_A\ne |z-y|_{\RR^3}$.

\parbf{\ref{ex:antipodal}.}
The spherical curve shown on the diagram does not have antipodal pairs of points.
However it has three points $x,y,z$ on one of its sides and their antipodal points $-x,-y,-z$ on the other.
Show that it is sufficient to conclude that the curve does not lie in any hemisphere.
%???PIC

\parbf{\ref{ex:bisection-of-S2}.}
Assume contrary, then by the hemisphere lemma (\ref{lem:hemisphere}) $\gamma$ lies in an open hemisphere.
In particular it cannot divide $\SS^2$ into two regions of equal area --- a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{ex:flaw}.}
The very first sentence is wrong --- it is \emph{not} sufficient to show that diameter iis at most 2.
For example an equilateral triangle with circumradius slightly above $1$ may have diameter (which is defined as the maximal distance between its points) slightly bigger than $\sqrt3$, so it can be made smaller that $2$.
%???+PIC

On the other hand, it is easy to modify the proof of the hemisphere lemma (\ref{lem:hemisphere}) to get a correct solution.
That is, (1) choose two points $p$ and $q$ on $\gamma$ that divide it into two arcs of the same length;
(2) set $z$ to be a midpoint of $p$ and $q$,
and (3) show that $\gamma$ lies in the unit disc centered at $z$.

Therefore we can choose $u$ so that

Observe that $\gamma_u$ runs in a semicircle $h$ and therefore $\gamma$ lies in a hemisphere with $h$ as a diameter.
