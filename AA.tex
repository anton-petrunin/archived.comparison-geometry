Let $f$ be a function on $\RR^3$ and $c$ be a real constant.
The set $L_c=\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{f(x,y,z)=c}$ is called \emph{level set} of $f$.
Recall that if the gradient of $f$ is does not vanish on $L_c$, then $L_c$ is a smooth surface.

Let $\vec v$ be a vector field defined on a set $A\subset \RR^3$.
A vector field $\vec w$ defined on a bigger set $B\supset A$
is called \emph{extension} of $\vec v$ if $\vec w=\vec v$ at any point in $A$.
If in addition $\vec v$ is a smooth vector field, than it is called \emph{smooth extension}. 


\begin{thm}{Lemma}
Suppose a smooth surface $\Sigma$ bounds a convex region $K$ in $\RR^3$.
Denote by $W$ the closed outer region of $\Sigma$; that is $W$ contains $\Sigma$ and all points in the complement of $K$.  
Then there is a unit vector field $\vec u$ defined on $W$ such that 
$\div \vec u\ge 0$.

It remains to show that $\tfrac{\partial}{\partial r}\langle\tfrac{\partial w_p}{\partial\theta},\tfrac{\partial w_p}{\partial r}\rangle=0$.

The curve $\sigma_r(t)=w(t,r)$ is a parametrization of the circle of radius $r$ and center at $p$ in $\Sigma$; that is, if $q=\sigma_r(t)$, then $|q-p|_\Sigma=r$.
If the latter is not the case, then a minimizing geodesic $[pq]_\Sigma$ would be shorter than $r$ and therefore $q$ would not be described uniquely in the polar coordinates. 

Note that $\tfrac{\partial}{\partial r}w\perp \tfrac{\partial}{\partial \theta}w$ if $r>0$;
otherwise for small $\eps>0$ the intrinsic distance from $p$ to $w(\theta\pm \eps,r)$ would be shorter than $r$, which contradicts the previous statement.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:loc-comp-l}
Let $w(\theta,r)$ and $\~w(\theta,r)$ be the polar coordinates of a surface $\Sigma$ at $p$ and its tangent plane $\T_p$ at zero, so $w(\theta,r)\z=\exp_p[\~w(\theta,r)]$.
Given a real interval $[a,b]$ consider the one parameter families of circular arcs $\sigma_r\:[a,b]\to \Sigma$ and $\~\sigma_r\:[a,b]\to \T_p$
$\sigma_r(t)\z=w(t,r)$ and $\~\sigma_r(t)=\~w(t,r)$.
Set $\ell(r)=\length \sigma_r$ and $\~\ell(r)\z=\length \~\sigma_r$.%
\footnote{Note that angular measure of $\~\sigma_r$ is $b-a$; therefore $\~\ell(r)=r\cdot(b-a)$.}

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
 \item If the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is nonnegative, then 
 \[\ell(r)\le \~\ell(r)\]
 for all small $r>0$.
 \item If the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is nonpositive, then 
 \[\ell(r)\ge \~\ell(r)\]
 for all small $r>0$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

Taking a limit as $b\to a$, we obtain the following corollary.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:w<w}
Let $w(\theta,r)$ and $\~w(\theta,r)$ be the polar coordinates of a surface $\Sigma$ at $p$ and its tangent plane $\T_p$ at zero, so $w(\theta,r)\z=\exp_p[\~w(\theta,r)]$.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
 \item If the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is nonnegative, then 
 \[|\tfrac{\partial}{\partial \theta} w|\le |\tfrac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \~w|\]
 for all small $r>0$.
 \item If the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is nonpositive, then 
\[|\tfrac{\partial}{\partial \theta} w|\ge |\tfrac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \~w|\]
 for all small $r>0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
From the above discussion, the polar coordinates $w(\theta,r)$ are semigeodesic;
that is, $w(\theta,r)$ satisfies the conditions in the first variation formula (\ref{prop:first-var}).
In particular if $\ell(r)=\length \sigma_r$, then
\[\ell'(r)=\Theta_{\sigma_r}\]
for any $r>0$.

By Gauss--Bonnet formula, the last identity can be rewritten as
\[\ell'(r)=2\cdot (b-a) -\iint_{\Delta_r}G,\eqlbl{eq:ell'}\]
where $\Delta_r$ is the sector in $\Sigma$ in the polar coordinates at $p$
\[\set{w(t,s)}{a\le t\le b,\ 0\le s\le r};\]
which is bounded by two geodesics from $p$ with angle $b-a$ 
and a circular arc that meets these geodesics at right angle.

Since the plane has vanishing Gauss curvature, we have
\[\~\ell'(r)=2\cdot (b-a),\eqlbl{eq:tilde-ell'}\]
which agrees with the formula for the length of the arc $\~\ell(r)\z=2\cdot\pi\cdot r$.

If the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is nonnegative,
the equations \ref{eq:ell'} and \ref{eq:tilde-ell'} imply that
\[\ell'(r)\le \~\ell'(r)\]
for any small $r$.

If the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is nonnegative,
the same equations imply that
\[\ell'(r)\ge \~\ell'(r)\]
for any small $r$.

Since $\ell(0)=\~\ell(0)$, integrating the inequalities proves both statements.\qeds

The following exercise provides a stronger statement.
It almost follow from the proof above, but one has to make an extra observation.


\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Assume $\Sigma$ is a smooth regular surface and $p\in\Sigma$,
denote by $\ell(r)$ the circumference of the circle with the center at $p$ and radius $r$ in $\Sigma$
and let $\~\ell(r)=2\cdot\pi\cdot r$ the circumference of the plane circle of radius $r$.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
 \item Show that if Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is nonnegative, then the function $r\mapsto \ell(r)$ is concave for small $r>0$. Conclude that the function $r\mapsto \frac{\ell(r)}{\~\ell(r)}$ is nonincreasing for small $r>0$.
\item Show that if Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ is nonpositive, then the function $r\mapsto \ell(r)$ is convex for small $r>0$. Conclude that the function $r\mapsto \frac{\ell(r)}{\~\ell(r)}$ is nondecresing for small $r>0$.

\section*{Proof via equidistant surfaces}

Recall that a surface $\Sigma$ is called \emph{orientable} if one can choose at each point $p$ of the surface
a unit normal vector $\Norm_p$  in such a way that the function $p\mapsto \Norm_p$ is continuous in every chart of $\Sigma$.
For immersed surfaces we should say that $\Norm$ is a continuous function defined on the parameter domain of the surface.
The map $\Norm$ is called a \emph{Gauss map} of the surface.

\begin{thm}{Claim}
Assume $\Sigma$ is a closed immersed surface with positive Gauss curvature, then it is orientable.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.} Indeed we can choose the unit normal vector $\Norm_p$ in such a way that both principle curvatures are positive. 
In this case the surface lies locally on the side of tangent plane $\T_p$ which is opposite from $\Norm_p$.

Evidently this choice is  continuous.
\qeds

The unit normal described in the proof of the claim will be called \emph{outer normal}.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:gauss-inverse}
Assume $\Sigma$ is a closed connected immersed surface with positive Gauss curvature.
Then the Gauss map $\Norm\:\Sigma \to \SS^2$ has a smooth regular inverse;
in particular, $\Sigma$ is a sphere.
\end{thm}

This lemma follows from two facts:
(1) if Gauss curvature does not vanish, then the  Gauss map is regular, in particular this map has a local inverse at each point
and
(2) the sphere $\SS^2$ is \emph{simply connected};
that is, $\SS^2$ is connected any closed curve in $\SS^2$ can be deformed continuously into a trivial curve that stays at one point.
The proof is standard in topology, we hope that the statement is intuitively obvious.
The reader might be able to reinvent the theory by trying to prove that if the map $\phi\:\SS^2\to\SS^2$ is smooth and regular, then it has an inverse.

\parbf{Equidistant surfaces.}
Assume $\Norm\:\Sigma\to \SS^2$ is a Gauss map of a smooth surface $\Sigma$.
Fix a real number $R$ and consider the map $h_R\:\Sigma\z\to\RR^3$ defined by $h_R\:p\mapsto p+R\cdot\Norm_p$.
The map $h_R$ describe the so called \emph{equidistant surface};
it is smooth by definition, but in general it does not have to be regular.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:curc<1/R}
Suppose $\Norm\:\Sigma\to \SS^2$ is a Gauss map of a surface $\Sigma$.
Assume the corresponding principle curvatures are nonnegative at all points. 
Then the equidistant surface $\Sigma_R$ is regular and its principle curvatures are positive and strictly smaller than $\tfrac1R$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
To prove regularity, let us use the special representation of $\Sigma$ as a graph $z=f(x,y)$ with the $x$ and $y$ axis in the principle directions of $\Sigma$ at $p$.\footnote{If we assume that $\Norm_p$ points in the direction of the $z$-axis, then $\Sigma$ is given in parametric form 
$h_0\:(x,y)\mapsto (x,y,f(x,y))$,
where $f\z=-\tfrac{k_1}2\cdot x^2-\tfrac{k_2}2\cdot y^2+o(x^2+y^2)$.}

Due to the choice of directions of $x$ and $y$ axis,
for the Gauss map $g(x,y)$, we have 
\begin{align*}
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x}g(0,0)&=(k_1,0,0),
\\
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial y}g(0,0)&=(0,k_2,0).
\end{align*}
Then $h_R=h_0+R\cdot g$; therefore
\begin{align*}
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x} h_R&=(1+R\cdot k_1,0,0),
\\
\tfrac{\partial}{\partial y} h_R&=(0,1+R\cdot k_2,0)
\end{align*}
which are linearly independent if $R\ge0$ and $k_1,k_2\ge 0$. 

If $\Sigma$ bounds a convex closed set $K$.
Then $\Sigma_R$ bounds $K_R$ --- the closed $R$-neighborhood of $K$;
that is, $K_R$ is the set of all points at distance at most $R$ from $K$.

Since $\Sigma$ is smooth it is supported at each point $p$ from inside by a small ball $B_\eps(o)$.
Then the ball $B_{R+\eps}(o)$ lies in $K_R$ and touches its boundary at the point corresponding to $p$.
Hence the principle curvatures at $p$ are at least $\tfrac1{R+\eps}$.

In the general case, a local chart of $\Sigma$ can be modified so that it has a piece of the original surface around $p$  and bounds a convex set.
Here is one way to do this:

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{30 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-38}
\vskip-0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

Choose a smooth function $\phi(x)$ that is convex increasing and such that for sufficiently small $\eps>0$ we have $\phi(x)=x$ if $x<\eps$ and $\phi(x)\to\infty$ as $x\to 2\cdot\eps$.
(Such functions do exist; moreover an explicit formula can be written, but we leave it without a proof.)

Assume $z=f(x,y)$ is a special representation of $\Sigma$ around $p$ by some convex function $f$.
Direct computations show that $h=\phi\circ f(x,y)$ is still convex.
The surface $\Sigma'$ described as the graph $z=h(x,y)$ bounds a convex closed set $K$ and the part of $\Sigma'$ described by 
the parameters $\set{(x,y)}{f(x,y)<\eps}$ coincide with a neighborhood of $p$ in $\Sigma$.
Hence the general case follows.\qeds

\parit{Proof assembling.}
Let $s\:\SS^2\z\to\RR^3$ be the parametization of $\Sigma$ provided by Lemma~\ref{lem:gauss-inverse}.
Then the equidistant surface $\Sigma_R$ can be parametrized by $s_R(u)= s(u)+R\cdot u$ for $u\in\SS^2$.
Rescaling $s_R$ by a  factor of $\tfrac1r$ we get the map $u\mapsto \tfrac1R\cdot s(u)+u$ which converges smoothly to the indentity map on the sphere $\SS^2$.
Therefore $\Sigma_R$ is embedded for sufficiently large $R$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{47 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-39}
\vskip-0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

Applying Theorem~\ref{thm:convex-embedded}, we get that $\Sigma_R$ bounds a convex set.

By Lemma~\ref{lem:curc<1/R}, the principle curvatures of $\Sigma_R$ are smaller than $\tfrac1R$.
Therefore the same idea as in Exercise~\ref{ex:convex-lagunov} shows that any point $p$ of $\Sigma_R$ can be supported by a ball of radius $R$ from inside.
Note that the center $p'$ of such ball has to lie on $\Sigma$;
indeed it lies at distance $R$ in the normal direction.
In other words, the map $s_0(u)=s_R(u)-R\cdot u$ is injective, or equivalently $\Sigma$  has no self-intersection.

\section*{Curve in a surface}


\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:gamma''=II}
Suppose $\gamma$ is a smooth curve in a smooth oriented surface $\Sigma$ with a unit normal field $\Norm$.
Then, the following identity holds for any time parameter $t$:
\[\langle \gamma''(t),\Norm\circ\gamma(t)\rangle=-\langle \gamma'(t),(\Norm\circ\gamma)'(t)\rangle=\langle S_{\gamma(t)}(\gamma'(t)),\gamma'(t)\rangle.\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} 
Fix a parameter value $t_0$; set $p=\gamma(t_0)$, $v=\gamma'(t_0)$ and $a\z=\gamma''(t_0)$;
so we need to show that
\[\langle a,\Norm_{p}\rangle=\II_p(v,v).\eqlbl{a-nu-II}\]
Let $z=f(x,y)$ be the local representaion of $\Sigma$ in the tangent-normal coordinates at $p$;
we assume that $\Norm$ points in the direction of~$\Norm_p$.

Without loss of generality may assume that $\gamma$ runs in the graph $z=f(x,y)$;
so 
\[\gamma(t)=\left(x(t),y(t),f(x(t),y(t))\right).\]
Then
\begin{align*}
\gamma'&=(x',y',\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}\cdot x'+\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}\cdot y');
\\
\gamma''
&=
{\small(x'',
y'',
 \tfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\cdot (x')^2
+
2\cdot \tfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y}\cdot x'\cdot y'
+
\tfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}\cdot (y')^2
+
\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}\cdot x''
+
\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}\cdot y'')}.
\end{align*}

Recall that $p=\gamma(t_0)=(0,0,0)$ and
\begin{align*}
f(0,0)&=0,
&
\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}(0,0)&=0,
&
\tfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}(0,0)&=0.
\end{align*}

Therefore 
\begin{align*}
v&=\left(x',y',0\right)(t_0);
\\
a&=\left(x'',y'',
\tfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\cdot (x')^2
+
2\cdot \tfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y}\cdot x'\cdot y'
+
\tfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}\cdot (y')^2\right)(t_0).
\end{align*}

Note that 
\[\II_p(v,v)=\left(\tfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\cdot (x')^2
+
2\cdot \tfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x\partial y}\cdot x'\cdot y'
+
\tfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}\cdot (y')^2\right)(t_0);\]
that is, the $z$-coordinate of the acceleration $a$ equals $\II_p(v,v)$ which is equivalent to~\ref{a-nu-II}.

\section{Shape}

The linear operator $S\:\T_p\to \T_p$ defined by the matrix multiplication
\[S\:(\begin{smallmatrix}
x\\y
\end{smallmatrix})
\mapsto
M_p\cdot(\begin{smallmatrix}
x\\y
\end{smallmatrix})\] is called \emph{shape operator} of $\Sigma$ at $p$.

For a vector $\vec w\in\T_p$, we use notation $S(\vec w)$ when it is clear from the context which base point $p$ and which surface we are working with;
otherwise we may use notations 
\[S_p(\vec w)\quad\text{or even}\quad S_p(\vec w)_\Sigma.\]













\section*{Shape operator}

Let $z=f(x,y)$ be a local representation of a smooth surface $\Sigma$ in the tangent-normal coordinates at a point $p$.
Let $M_p$ be the Hessian matrix.
Recall that $(x,y)$-plane coincides with the tangent plane $\T_p$.

The operator $S_p\:\T_p\to \T_p$ defined by the matrix multiplication
\[S_p\:(\begin{smallmatrix}
x\\y
\end{smallmatrix})
\mapsto
M_p\cdot(\begin{smallmatrix}
x\\y
\end{smallmatrix})\] is called \emph{shape operator} of $\Sigma$ at $p$.
The following proposition implies that $S_p$ does not depend on the choice of $(x,y)$-coordinates on $\T_p$.





Given two vectors $\vec v=(\begin{smallmatrix}a\\b
\end{smallmatrix})$ and $\vec w=(\begin{smallmatrix}c\\d
\end{smallmatrix})$ in the $(x,y)$-plane, consider the value 
\[\II_p(\vec v,\vec w)\df(D_{\vec w}D_{\vec v}f)(0,0),\]
where $D$ denotes the directional derivative.
The function $(v,w)\z\mapsto \II_p(v,w)$ is called the \emph{second fundamental form} at $p$;\label{page:second fundamental form}
it takes two tangent vectors $v$ and $w$ at $p$ and spits out the real number $\II_p(v,w)$.

The second fundamental form can be written in terms of the Hessian matrix.
Indeed if 
$w=(\begin{smallmatrix}a\\b
\end{smallmatrix})$ 
and 
$v=(\begin{smallmatrix}c\\d
\end{smallmatrix})$, then 
\[D_w=a\cdot \tfrac\partial{\partial x}+b\cdot \tfrac\partial{\partial y}\quad\text{and}\quad D_v=c\cdot \tfrac\partial{\partial x}+d\cdot \tfrac\partial{\partial y}.\]
Therefore 
\[\begin{aligned}
\II_p(w,v)&\df(D_wD_vf)(0,0)=
\\
&=a\cdot c\cdot \ell+(a\cdot d+ b\cdot c)\cdot m +b\cdot d\cdot n=
\\
&=\langle M_p\cdot w,v\rangle=
\\
&=\langle M_p\cdot v,w\rangle.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:DwDv}\]
Note that from \ref{eq:DwDv} it follows that $\II_p$ is symmetric; that is,
\[\II_p(v,w)=\II_p(w,v)\]
for any two tangent vectors $v,w\in \T_p$.





\parit{Proof.}
Assume an oriented surface $\Sigma$ is written locally as a graph $z\z=f(x,y)$ in the tangent-normal coordinates at $p\in\Sigma$.
As usual we assume that the normal vector $\Norm_p$ points in the direction of the $z$-axis,
in this case the normal vector at any point of the graph points up; that is, its $z$-coordinate  is positive.

Consider the corresponding chart  of $\Sigma$:
\[s(x,y)\z=(x,y,f(x,y)).\]
Denote by $\Norm(x,y)$ the unit normal vector at $s(x,y)$; it is a shortcut notation for $\Norm_{s(x,y)}$.

Note that $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial x}(0,0)=(1,0,0)$ and $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial y}(0,0)=(0,1,0)$.
For a tangent vector 
\[v=(a\cdot\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial x}+b\cdot\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial y})(0,0) =(a,b,0)\in \T_p\]
we have that
\[
\begin{aligned}
S_p(v)&=-D_v\Norm(0,0)=
\\
&=-(a\cdot \tfrac{\partial \Norm}{\partial x}+b\cdot \tfrac{\partial \Norm}{\partial y})(0,0),
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:S=D}
\]
where $D_v$ denotes the directional derivative along a vector $v$ in the $(x,y)$-plane which is $\T_p$.

Indeed, the first equality follows from \ref{eq:shape} and the definition of differential \ref{eq:differenital} applied for the curve $\gamma(t)=(a\cdot t,b\cdot t, f(a\cdot t,b\cdot t))$ at $t=0$ and the second follow since
$D_v=a\cdot \tfrac{\partial }{\partial x}+b\cdot \tfrac{\partial }{\partial y}$.

Taking partial derivatives of $\langle\Norm,\Norm\rangle=1$, we get that 
\begin{align*}
0&=\tfrac{\partial}{\partial x} \langle\Norm,\Norm\rangle=
\\
&=2\cdot\langle\tfrac{\partial\Norm}{\partial x},\Norm\rangle.
\end{align*}
That is, $\langle\tfrac{\partial\Norm}{\partial x},\Norm\rangle=0$ and the same way we get $\langle\tfrac{\partial\Norm}{\partial y},\Norm\rangle=0$.
By \ref{eq:S=D} it follows that $S_p(v)\perp \Norm_p$, or equivalently $S_p(v)\in\T_p$ for any $v\in \T_p$.

Further, since $\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial x}, \tfrac{\partial s}{\partial y}\in\T_{s(x,y)}\Sigma$
and $\Norm(x,y)\perp\T_{s(x,y)}\Sigma$,
we have that
\[\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial x}\rangle\equiv 0
\quad\text{and}\quad
\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial y}\rangle\equiv 0.\]
Taking a derivative of these identities, we get that
\[\begin{aligned}
\langle \tfrac{\partial\Norm}{\partial x},\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial x}\rangle+\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial^2 s}{\partial x^2}\rangle&\equiv 0,
\\
\langle \tfrac{\partial\Norm}{\partial y},\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial x}\rangle+\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial^2 s}{\partial y\partial x}\rangle&\equiv 0,
\\
\langle \tfrac{\partial\Norm}{\partial x},\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial y}\rangle+\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial^2 s}{\partial x\partial y}\rangle&\equiv 0,
\\
\langle \tfrac{\partial\Norm}{\partial y},\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial y}\rangle+\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial^2 s}{\partial y^2}\rangle&\equiv 0,
\end{aligned}
\]

Fix two vectors $v=(a,b,0)$ and $w=(c,d,0)$ in $\T_p$ (which is the $(x,y)$-plane).
Since $\Norm(0,0)=(0,0,1)$ we get 
\[f(x,y)\equiv\langle\Norm(0,0),s(x,y)\rangle.\]
Therefore by \ref{eq:S=D}, \ref{eq:shape=second} and \ref{eq:DwDv} we get that 
\begin{align*}
\langle S_p(v),w\rangle 
&=-\langle  a\cdot \tfrac{\partial \Norm}{\partial x}+b\cdot \tfrac{\partial \Norm}{\partial y},c\cdot \tfrac{\partial s}{\partial x}+d\cdot \tfrac{\partial s}{\partial y}\rangle(0,0)=
\\
&=-\bigl(a\cdot c\cdot\langle \tfrac{\partial \Norm}{\partial x},\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial x}\rangle 
+a\cdot d\cdot\langle \tfrac{\partial \Norm}{\partial x},\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial y}\rangle+

+b\cdot c\cdot\langle \tfrac{\partial \Norm}{\partial y},\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial x}\rangle

%???product rule???

The proof is based on three identities $\langle\Norm,\Norm\rangle=1$ and $\langle\Norm,\vec w\rangle=0$ for any tangent vector $\vec w$ and the unit normal vector $\Norm$ with the same base point.
It is sufficient to take directional derivatives of these two identity and understand the result.
In the proof we use the following product rule:
\[D_{\vec w}\langle\vec u,\vec v\rangle
=
\langle D_{\vec w}\vec u,\vec v\rangle+\langle\vec u,D_{\vec w}\vec v\rangle.\]
which easely follows from the standard product rule and the definition of directional derivative.

\parit{Proof.}
Since $\Norm$ is a unit normal field, we have the identity
\[1=\langle\Norm,\Norm\rangle.\]
Taking the directional derivative along $\vec w$, we get
\begin{align*}0&=D_{\vec w}\langle\Norm,\Norm\rangle=
\\
&=2\cdot \langle D_{\vec w}\Norm,\Norm\rangle.
\end{align*}
That is, $D_{\vec w}\Norm$ lies in the orthogonal complement of $\Norm_p$;
or, equivalently, $D_{\vec w}\Norm\in\T_p$.

Note that both sides of the identity \ref{eq:shape=-dNorm} are linear in $\vec w$.
Therefore it is sufficient to check the identity for two basis vectors $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ of $\T_p$.
That is, it is sufficient to establish the following two identities:
\begin{align*}
S(\vec u)&= -D_{\vec u}\Norm,
&
S(\vec v)&= -D_{\vec v}\Norm.
\end{align*}
Further, since $D_{\vec u}\Norm,D_{\vec v}\Norm\in\T_p$, to prove the two vector indentities, it sufficient to prove the following four real identities:
\[\begin{aligned}

Let $z=f(x,y)$ be a local description of $\Sigma$ in the tangent-normal coordinates at $p$.
Note that 
\[s(u,v)=(u,v,f(u,v))\]
describes a chart of $\Sigma$ at $p$.
Let us prove the indentities \ref{eq:<S(u),v>=<-Du,v>} for the basis $\vec u=\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}$ and $\vec v=\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}$.
Note that 
\[f=\langle s, \vec k\rangle=\langle s, \nu(p)\rangle.\]???


Note that the vector fields $\vec u=\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}$ and $\vec v=\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}$ are tangent to $\Sigma$  and therefore they are orthogonal to $\Norm$;
that is, we have two identities:
\[\begin{aligned}
0&=\langle \Norm,\vec u\rangle=\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}\rangle,
\\
0&=\langle \Norm,\vec v\rangle=\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}\rangle.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:<Norm,uv>}\]
Applying the product rule for the directional derivative of the first identity in \ref{eq:<Norm,uv>} along $\vec u$, we get that
\begin{align*}
0&=D_{\vec u}\langle \Norm,\vec u\rangle=
\\
&=\langle D_{\vec v}\Norm,\vec u\rangle
+
\langle \Norm,D_{\vec v}\vec u\rangle
\end{align*}
Note that $\langle\nu(p),s(u,v)\rangle=f(u,v)$.
Therefore evaluating the last expression at $p$, we get
\[\langle D_{\vec v}\Norm,\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}\rangle+\tfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial v\partial u}=0.\]



Since $\tfrac{\partial^2 s}{\partial u\partial v}=\tfrac{\partial^2 s}{\partial v\partial u}$, we get
\[\langle S({\vec u}),\vec v\rangle=\langle {\vec u},S(\vec v)\rangle;\]
that is, the identity \ref{eq:S-self-adjoint} for two vectors $\vec u=\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}$ and $\vec v=\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}$.
Evidently the identity \ref{eq:S-self-adjoint} holds if $\vec u=\vec v$.

It follows that the identity \ref{eq:S-self-adjoint} holds for any pair of vectors in a basis of $\T_p$; that is we have the following four identities:
\begin{align*}
 \langle S({\vec u}),\vec u\rangle&=\langle {\vec u},S(\vec u)\rangle,
 &\langle S({\vec u}),\vec v\rangle&=\langle {\vec u},S(\vec v)\rangle
 \\
 \langle S({\vec v}),\vec u\rangle&=\langle {\vec v},S(\vec u)\rangle,
 &\langle S({\vec v}),\vec v\rangle&=\langle {\vec v},S(\vec v)\rangle.
\end{align*}

Since both sides of this identiy \ref{eq:S-self-adjoint} are linear in $\vec u$ and $\vec v$,
the latter is sufficient to conclude that \ref{eq:S-self-adjoint} for any pair of tangent vectors at $p$.
Let us present the formal calculations for two vectors $a\cdot \vec u+b\cdot\vec v$ and $c\cdot \vec u+d\cdot\vec v$:
\begin{align*} 
\langle S(a\cdot \vec u+b\cdot\vec v),c\cdot \vec u+d\cdot\vec v\rangle
&=a\cdot c\cdot\langle S({\vec u}),\vec u\rangle + a\cdot d\cdot \langle S({\vec u}),\vec v\rangle+
\\
&+b\cdot c\cdot\langle S({\vec v}),\vec u\rangle + b\cdot d\cdot \langle S({\vec v}),\vec v\rangle=
\\
&=a\cdot c\cdot\langle {\vec u},S(\vec u)\rangle + a\cdot d\cdot \langle {\vec u},S(\vec v)\rangle+
\\
&+b\cdot c\cdot\langle {\vec v},S(\vec u)\rangle + b\cdot d\cdot \langle {\vec v},S(\vec v)\rangle=
\\
&=\langle a\cdot \vec u+b\cdot\vec v,S(c\cdot \vec u+d\cdot\vec v)\rangle.
\end{align*}

The vectors $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ are tangent to $\Sigma$, we have

Let $\Sigma$ be an smooth oriented surface in the Euclidean space;
denote by $\Norm$ its unit normal field.

Given a point $p$ on $\Sigma$ and a tangent vector $\vec w$ at $p$,
the shape operator of $\vec w$ at $p$ is defined as
\[S(\vec w)=-D_{\vec w}\Norm,\]
where $D_{\vec w}$ denotes the directional derivative defined in \ref{def:directional-derivative}.




\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Let $\Sigma$ be an smooth oriented surface and $p\in \Sigma$.
Then the shape operator $S_p$ is a linear self-adjoint operator defined on the tangent plane $\T_p$;
that is, $\vec v\mapsto S_p(\vec v)$ defines a linear map $\T_p\to \T_p$ and
\[\langle S_p(\vec u), \vec v\rangle =\langle \vec u, S_p(\vec v)\rangle\eqlbl{eq:S-self-adjoint}\]
for any two vectors $\vec u, \vec v \in \T_p$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
The linearity follow from \ref{ex:linerity}.

Since $\Norm$ is a unit normal field, we have the identity
\[1=\langle\Norm,\Norm\rangle.\]
Taking the directional derivative along $\vec v$, we get
\begin{align*}0&=D_{\vec v}\langle\Norm,\Norm\rangle=
\\
&=2\cdot \langle D_{\vec v}\Norm,\Norm\rangle=
\\
&=-2\cdot \langle S({\vec v}),\Norm\rangle.
\end{align*}
That is, $S_p({\vec v})$ lies in the orthogonal complement of $\Norm_p$;
or, equivalently, $S_p({\vec v})\in\T_p$.

Now let us fix a chart $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ of $\Sigma$ at $p$.
Note that the vectors $\vec u=\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}$ and $\vec v=\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}$ are tangent to $\Sigma$ at their base points and therefore they are orthogonal to $\Norm$;
that is we have two identities:
\[\begin{aligned}
0&=\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}\rangle,
\\
0&=\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}\rangle.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:<Norm,uv>}\]
Taking a directional derivative of the first identity in \ref{eq:<Norm,uv>} along $\vec v$ , we get that
\begin{align*}
0&=D_{\vec v}\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}\rangle=
\\
&=\langle D_{\vec v}\Norm,\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}\rangle
+
\langle \Norm,D_{\vec v}\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}\rangle=
\\
&=-\langle S({\vec v}),\vec u\rangle+\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial^2 s}{\partial v\partial u}\rangle.
\intertext{Analogously, taking a directional derivative of the second identity in \ref{eq:<Norm,uv>} along $\vec u$, we get that}
0&=D_{\vec u}\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}\rangle=
\\
&=\langle D_{\vec u}\Norm,\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}\rangle
+
\langle \Norm,D_{\vec u}\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}\rangle=
\\
&=-\langle S({\vec u}),\vec v\rangle+\langle \Norm,\tfrac{\partial^2 s}{\partial u\partial v}\rangle.
\end{align*}

Since $\tfrac{\partial^2 s}{\partial u\partial v}=\tfrac{\partial^2 s}{\partial v\partial u}$, we get
\[\langle S({\vec u}),\vec v\rangle=\langle {\vec u},S(\vec v)\rangle;\]
that is, the identity \ref{eq:S-self-adjoint} for two vectors $\vec u=\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}$ and $\vec v=\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}$.
Evidently the identity \ref{eq:S-self-adjoint} holds if $\vec u=\vec v$.

It follows that the identity \ref{eq:S-self-adjoint} holds for any pair of vectors in a basis of $\T_p$; that is we have the following four identities:
\begin{align*}
 \langle S({\vec u}),\vec u\rangle&=\langle {\vec u},S(\vec u)\rangle,
 &\langle S({\vec u}),\vec v\rangle&=\langle {\vec u},S(\vec v)\rangle
 \\
 \langle S({\vec v}),\vec u\rangle&=\langle {\vec v},S(\vec u)\rangle,
 &\langle S({\vec v}),\vec v\rangle&=\langle {\vec v},S(\vec v)\rangle.
\end{align*}

Since both sides of this identiy \ref{eq:S-self-adjoint} are linear in $\vec u$ and $\vec v$,
the latter is sufficient to conclude that \ref{eq:S-self-adjoint} for any pair of tangent vectors at $p$.
Let us present the formal calculations for two vectors $a\cdot \vec u+b\cdot\vec v$ and $c\cdot \vec u+d\cdot\vec v$:
\begin{align*} 
\langle S(a\cdot \vec u+b\cdot\vec v),c\cdot \vec u+d\cdot\vec v\rangle
&=a\cdot c\cdot\langle S({\vec u}),\vec u\rangle + a\cdot d\cdot \langle S({\vec u}),\vec v\rangle+
\\
&+b\cdot c\cdot\langle S({\vec v}),\vec u\rangle + b\cdot d\cdot \langle S({\vec v}),\vec v\rangle=
\\
&=a\cdot c\cdot\langle {\vec u},S(\vec u)\rangle + a\cdot d\cdot \langle {\vec u},S(\vec v)\rangle+
\\
&+b\cdot c\cdot\langle {\vec v},S(\vec u)\rangle + b\cdot d\cdot \langle {\vec v},S(\vec v)\rangle=
\\
&=\langle a\cdot \vec u+b\cdot\vec v,S(c\cdot \vec u+d\cdot\vec v)\rangle.

 Also, the last sentence should have two additional commas; one after "topological plane,"

According to \ref{ex:differential-range}, the shape operator takes a tangent vector at $p$ and spits a tangent vector to $\SS^2$ at $\nu_p$.
Note that $\nu_p$ is the normal vector to $\SS^2$ at $\nu_p$.
In other words the tangent plane $\T_p\Sigma$ is parallel to the tangent plane $\T_{\nu_p}\SS^2$,
or $\T_p\Sigma=\T_{\nu_p}\SS^2$, if we consider the tangent planes as linear spaces. 












Let us write $\Sigma$ in the spherical $(\rho,u)$-coordinates where $\rho\ge 0$ and $u\in\SS^2$.



Consider the map $f\:\Sigma\to\SS^2$ defined by $f(x)=\tfrac1{|x|}\cdot x$.
By construction $f$ is a smooth map.
Since $R$ is convex, and $\Sigma$ is bounded, on any ray from the origin there is exactly one point of $\Sigma$;
that is, $f$ gives a continuous bijection between $\Sigma$ and $\SS^2$.
Since $\SS^2$ is compact, the inverse map $f^{-1}\:\SS^2\to \Sigma$ is continuous; 
this is, $f$ is a homeomorphism.
The latter statement is a standard result in topology \ref{thm:Hausdorff-compact}.

Summarizing, we proved that $\Sigma$ is a topological sphere.

Let us show that that $f$ is regular.
In other words, for any cart $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$ of $\Sigma$
the vectors $\tfrac{\partial f\circ s}{\partial u}$ and $\tfrac{\partial f\circ s}{\partial v}$ are linearly independent.

Note that
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial (f\circ s)}{\partial u}&=\frac{\partial}{\partial u}\frac{s}{|s|}=
\\
&=\frac{1}{|s|}\cdot \frac{\partial s}{\partial u}+\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial u}\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\langle s,s\rangle}}\right)\cdot s=
\\
&=\frac{1}{|s|}\cdot \frac{\partial s}{\partial u}
-
\left(\frac{\langle s,\frac{\partial s}{\partial u}\rangle}{|s|^3}\right)\cdot s=
\\
&=\frac{1}{|s|}\cdot \left(\frac{\partial s}{\partial u}\right)^\perp_s,
\intertext{where $v^\perp_s$ denotes the orthogonal projection of the vector $v$ to the line in the direction of $s$. 
The same way we get}
\frac{\partial (f\circ s)}{\partial v}&=\frac{1}{|s|}\cdot \left(\frac{\partial s}{\partial v}\right)^\perp_s.
\end{align*}

Since $R$ is convex and the origin in its interior, 
$s(u,v)$ can not point in the direction of the tangent plane $\T_{s(u,v)}$;
that is, three vectors $s(u,v)$, $\frac{\partial s}{\partial u}(u,v)$ and $\frac{\partial s}{\partial v}(u,v)$ are linearly independent.
Whence the projections $\left(\frac{\partial s}{\partial u}\right)^\perp_s$ and $ \left(\frac{\partial s}{\partial v}\right)^\perp_s$ are linearly independent
and therefore $f$ is regular.
By the inverse function theorem the inverse $f^{-1}\:\SS^2\to \Sigma$ is also regular;
that is, $\Sigma$ is a smooth sphere.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Let $\Sigma$ be a complete oriented surface with 
nonnegative principal curvatures at all points.
Then $\Sigma$ bounds a convex region $R$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\nu$ be the unit normal field on $\Sigma$.
Consider the open region $R$ bounded by $\Sigma$ that lies on the side of $\nu$;
that is $\nu$ points inside of $R$ at any point of $\Sigma$.

Fix a plane $\Pi$ intersecting $R$.
Consider a conn

Since $\Sigma$ is connected, so is $R$;
moreover any two points in the interior of $R$ can be connected by a polygonal line in in the interior of~$R$.

Assume the interior of $R$ is not convex; that is, there are points $x,y\in R$ and a point $z$ between $x$ and $y$ that does not lie in the interior of $R$.
Consider a polygonal  line $\beta$ from $x$ to $y$ in the interior of $R$.
Let $y_0$ be the first point on $\beta$ such that the chord $[x,y_0]$ touches $\Sigma$ at some point, say~$z_0$.

\qeds












\parit{Proof.}
Denote by $\Gamma$ the graph $z=f(x,y)$.
Assume contrary; that is, $\Gamma$ lies between two planes $z=\pm C$.

Note $f$ can not be constant.
It follows that there is a line $\ell$ in $\RR^3$ with three points $a,b,c$ in the same order such that 
$a$ and $c$ are above $\Gamma$ and $b$ is below $\Gamma$.
Without loss of generality we can assume that the $z$-coordinate of $c$ is bigger than $C$.

Consider one parameter family of planes $\Pi_t$ containing $\ell$ that starts and ends at the vertical plane $\Pi_0=\Pi_1$ and rotates by angle $\pi$ while $t$ goes from $0$ to $1$.
For each $t$, consider the connected component $\Omega_t$ of $a$ in the subset of $\Pi_t$ that lies above $\Gamma$.

Let us show that $\Omega_t\not\ni c$ for some $t$.

If  $\Omega_t\ni c$, then $a$ can be connected by a path to $c$ in $\Omega_t$.
Since $\Gamma$ is saddle, the point $b$ cannot be surrounded by a closed curve in $\Omega_t$;
otherwise we would get a contradiction to ???.
Whence a any path from $a$ to $c$ in $\Omega_t$ might pass $b$ on the right side or on the left side,
but there is no pair of such paths that pass $b$ on both sides.
In particular we can divide subdivide the parameter values $[0,1]$ into three sets $t\in R$ if the path  in $\Omega_t$  goes on the right side from $b$,  $L$ if the path in $\Omega_t$ goes on the right side from $b$ and $N=[0,1]\backslash(R\cup L)$ if there is no path in $\Omega_t$ from $a$ to $b$.

Notice that $R$ and $L$ are open; indeed, if a path $\gamma$ lies in $\Omega_{t_0}$, then, since the epigraph $z>f(x,y)$ is open, all close paths lie in the epigraph.
In particular there will be a path from $a$ to $b$ in $\Omega_t$ for all $t$ sufficiently close to $t_0$,
evidently it goes on the same side from $b$.

Notice that $R\ni 0$ and $L\ni 1$; that is $R$ and $L$ are nonempty.
Since $[0,1]$ is connected, it can not be decomposed into two open nonempty sets.

(In fact one can show that $s=\sup R$ lies in $N$.)


Fix $t\in N$; note that $\Omega_t$ lies between the planes $z=\pm C$;

Denote by $\Gamma_t$ the part of the graph $\Gamma$ that lies above $\Omega_t$.
By Sard's lemma we can assume that $\Gamma_t$ is a smooth surface with boundary on $\Pi_t$.

Denote by $N$ the plane perpendicular to $\ell$.
Let $n$ be the projection of $\Pi_t$ to $N$; 
it is a line in $N$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:saddle-projection}
Let $\Omega$ is an open convex set in the $(x,y)$-plane and 
$\Sigma$ be a compact saddle surface in $\RR^3$ with boundary line $\gamma$.
Denote by $\hat \Sigma$ and $\hat\gamma$ the orthogonal projections of $\Sigma$ and $\gamma$ to the $(x,y)$-plane in $\RR^3$.
Assume that $\hat\gamma$ lies outside of $\Omega$.
Show that each connected component of $\Omega\backslash \hat\Sigma$ is convex. 
\end{thm}


\parit{Hint:} 
Assume contrary; that is, for some connected component $\Theta$ there is a line $\ell$ that goes in $\Theta$, out and in again.
Observe that the same argument as in the lens lemma (\ref{lem:lens}) shows that the boundary of $\Theta$ has a locally supporting circle from inside.
Take the cylinder $C$ over this circle, observe that $C$ is supports $\Sigma$ and apply \ref{cor:surf-support}.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}
There is no complete strictly saddle surface in the cylinder $y^2+z^2\le R^2, z\ge 0$ that has boundary line on the $(x,y)$-plane.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume contrary; let $\Sigma$ be such a surface.
Consider the projection $\hat\Sigma$ of $\Sigma$ to $(x,z)$-plane;
it lies on distance at most $R$ from $x$-axis.

Note that by \ref{ex:saddle-projection} the complement of $\hat\Sigma$ in the upper half-plane is convex.
It follows that $\hat\Sigma$ is a strip described by $0\le z\le r$ for some $r>0$.
Whence the plane $z=r$ supports $\Sigma$ at some point $p$. 
By \ref{cor:surf-support}, $K(p)_\Sigma\ge0$ --- a contradiction.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:signed-distance}
Let $\gamma$ be a simple smooth regular closed plane curve.
Assume it is parametrized so that the bounded region lies on the left from $\gamma$.
Given a point $p\in\RR^2$ denote by $f(p)$ the \emph{signed distance} to $\gamma$;
that is, $|f(p)|$ is the distance to $\gamma$ and $f(p)<0$ if $p$ is surrounded by $\gamma$; otherwise $f(p)\ge0$.
Suppose $\tau,\nu$ denotes the Frenet frame of $\gamma$.

\section*{DNA inequality*}

Recall that curvature of a spherical curve is at least $1$
(Exercise~\ref{ex:curvature-of-spherical-curve}).
In particular the length of spherical curve can not exceed its total curvature.
The following theorem shows that the same inequality holds for \emph{closed} curves in a unit ball.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:DNA}
Let $\gamma$ be a nontrivial closed curve that lies in a unit ball.
Then 
\[\tc\gamma\ge \length\gamma.\]

\end{thm}

In the proof we use \ref{def:total-curv-poly} to define for the total curvature;
according to \ref{thm:total-curvature=}, it is more general than the smooth definition on page \pageref{page:total curvature of:smooth-def}.

\parit{Proof.}
We will show that 
\[\tc\gamma> \length\gamma.\]
for any closed polygonal line $\gamma=p_1\dots p_{n}$ in a unit ball.
It implies the theorem since in any nontrivial closed curve we can inscribe a closed polygonal line with arbitrary close total curvature and length.

The indexes are taken modulo $n$, in particular $p_{n}=p_0$, $p_{n+1}=p_1$ and so on.
Denote by $\theta_i$ the external angle of $\gamma$ at $p_i$;
that is,
\[\theta_i=\pi-\measuredangle p_{i-1}p_ip_{i+1}.\]

Denote by $o$ the center of the ball.
Consider a sequence of $n+1$ plane triangles
\begin{align*}
\triangle q_0s_0q_1
&\cong 
\triangle p_0op_1,
\\
\triangle q_1s_1q_2
&\cong 
\triangle p_1op_2,
\\
&\dots
\\
\triangle q_{n}s_nq_{n+1}
&\cong 
\triangle p_nop_{n+1},
\end{align*}
such that the points $q_0,q_1\dots$ lie on one line in that order and all the points $s_0,\dots,s_n$ lie on one side from this line.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-16}
\vskip0mm
\end{figure}

Since $p_0=p_n$ and $p_1=p_{n+1}$, we have that
\[\triangle q_{n}s_nq_{n+1}\cong 
\triangle p_nop_{n+1}=\triangle p_0op_1\cong\triangle q_{0}s_0q_1,\]
so $s_0q_0q_ns_n$ is a parallelogram.
Therefore
\begin{align*}
|s_0-s_1|+\dots+|s_{n-1}-s_n|
&\ge|s_n-s_0|=
\\
&=|q_0-q_n|=
\\
&=|p_0-p_1|+\dots+|p_{n-1}-p_n|
\\
&=\length \gamma.
\end{align*}

Note that 
\begin{align*}
\theta_i&=\pi-\measuredangle p_{i-1}p_ip_{i+1}\ge
\\
&\ge\pi-\measuredangle p_{i-1}p_io-\measuredangle op_ip_{i+1}=
\\
&=\pi-\measuredangle q_{i-1}q_is_{i-1}-\measuredangle s_iq_iq_{i+1}=
\\
&=\measuredangle s_{i-1}q_is_i>
\\
&>|s_{i-1}-s_i|;
\end{align*}
the last inequality follows since $|q_i-s_{i-1}|=|q_i-s_i|=|p_i-o|\le 1$.
That is, 
\[\theta_i>|s_{i-1}-s_i|\]
for each $i$.

It follows that
\begin{align*}
\tc \gamma
&=\theta_1+\dots+\theta_n>
\\
&> |s_{0}-s_1|+\dots |s_{n-1}-s_n|\ge 
\\
&\ge\length \gamma.
\end{align*}
Hence the result.

This theorem was proved by Don Chakerian \cite{chakerian};
for plane curves it was prved earlier by Istv\'{a}n F\'{a}ry \cite{fary-DNA}.
Few proofs of this theorem are discussed by Serge Tabachnikov~\cite{tabachnikov}.
He also conjectured the following closely related statement:

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Suppose a closed regular smooth curve $\gamma$ lies in a convex figure with the perimeter $2\cdot \pi$.
Then 
\[\tc\gamma\ge \length\gamma.\]

\end{thm}

It was proved by Jeffrey Lagarias and Thomas Richardson \cite{lagarias-richardso}; latter a simpler proof was given by Alexander Nazarov and Fedor Petrov~\cite{nazarov-petrov}.
The proof is annoyingly difficult; we do not present it here.












\section*{Complex coordinates}

It is often convenient to use complex coordinate on the plane,
it packs two coordinates $(x,y)$ in one complex number $z=x+i\cdot y$.

In particular any vector $w$ in $\RR^2$ can be regarded as a complex number.
Note that $i\cdot w$ is the vector obtained from $w$ by the counterclockwise rotation by $\tfrac\pi2$.

The same formula holds for any closed curve, if one use \emoh{signed area} surrounded by curve;
that is we count area surrounded by curve with multiplicity --- for each region cut by the curve from the sphere we count how many times the curve goes around it counterclockwise and multiply the area of the region by this number.
In order to be defined correctly we need to specify a pole on the spherelying and stating that its region has zero multiplicity. 
When you cross the curve the mulitplicity changes by $\pm1$; it increases is the curve cross the ways from left to right and decreasing otherwise.

Note that for the Gauss curvature of unit sphere is identically 1
Therefore 
\[\area\Delta=\int_\Delta G.\]
That is, \ref{eq:sphere-gauss-bonnet} is Gauss--Bonnet formula for spherical triangle.
Applying this formula for each triangle in a  triangulation of polygon and summing up, we get Gauss--Bonnet formula for arbitrary spherical polygon.

Since any smooth simple closed curve can be approximated by a polygon, we get that the 





Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth regular oriented surface and $\nu\:\Sigma\to \SS^2$ be its Gauss map.
Assume $\alpha$ is a smooth unit-speed curve in $\Sigma$. 
Then for any $t$ the vectors $\nu(t)=\nu(\gamma(t))$ and the velocity vector $\tau(t)\gamma'(t)$ are unit vectos that are normal to each other.
Denote by $\mu(t)$ the unit vector that is normal to both $\nu(t)$ and $\tau(t)$ such that for any $t$ the triple $(\tau(t),\mu(t),\nu(t)$ is an oriented basis (say $\mu(t)=[\nu(t),\tau(t)]$, where $[{*},{*}]$ denotes the vector product).

Since $\alpha$ is unit-speed, the acceleration $\alpha''(t)\perp\tau(t)$;
therefore at any parameter value $t$, we have
\[\alpha''(t)=k_n(t)\cdot \nu(t)+k_g(t)\cdot \mu(t),\]
for some real numbers $k_n$ and $k_g$.
The numbers $k_n(t)$ and $k_g(t)$ are called \emph{normal} and \emph{geodesic curvature} of $\alpha$ at $t$ correspondingly.
The geodesic curvature vanishes if and only if $\alpha$ is a geodesic; 
it measures how much a given curve diverges from a geodesic.

Locally $\alpha$ cuts $\Sigma$ into two parts, left and right.
The left part is the one that lies in the direction of $\mu(t)$ and the opposite is right.


\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Suppose $\Delta$ is a disc in a surfaces $\Sigma$ 
bounded bounded by a simple closed regular curve $\alpha$.
Assume that $\alpha$ is oriented such that $\Delta$ lies on the left from $\alpha$.
Then
\[\int_\Delta G+\int_\alpha k_g=2\cdot \pi,\]
where $G$ denotes the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ and
$k_g$ denotes the geodesic curvature curvature of $\alpha$.

\end{thm}

We will give an informal proof of this formula based on the bike wheel interpretation described in the previous section.
We suppose that it is intuitively clear that moving the axis of the wheel without changing its direction does not change the direction of the wheel's spokes.
More precisely, we need the following:

\begin{thm}{Claim}
Assume we keep the axis of a non-spinning bike wheel and perform the following two experiments:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item We moved it around and bring it back to the original position. 
As a result the wheel might rotate by some angle; let us measure this angle.

\item we move the direction of the axis the same as before without moving the center of the wheel and again measure the angle of rotation.
\end{enumerate}

Then the resulting angle in these two experiments is the same. 
\end{thm}

\section{Gauss--Bonnet formula}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Suppose $\gamma$ is a simple broken geodesic line that cuts a disc $\Delta$ from the surface $\Sigma$.
Assume that $\gamma$ is oriented so that $\Delta$ lies on the left from $\Sigma$.
Then 
\[\tgc\gamma+\iint_\Delta G=2\cdot \pi,\]
where $G$ denotes the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$.
\end{thm}

Note that if $\Sigma$ is a plane, then geodesic in $\Sigma$ are formed by line segments.
In this case the statement of theorem follows from Exercise~\ref{ex:pm2pi}.
In the next section we will prove the formula for the unit sphere;
latter we will use it in the sketch of the proof of the general case.









\section{Gauss map}

Let $\Sigma$ be a surface in the Euclidean space.
Given a point $p\in\Sigma$ consider a unit vector $\nu(p)$ that is normal to the tangent plane $\T_p$. 
The unit normal vector $\nu(p)$ is defined uniquely up to sign at each point $p\in \Sigma$.
If the choice of the sign is made so that the map $\nu\:p\mapsto \nu(p)$ is continuous,
then the map $\nu$ is called \emph{Gauss map}.

The Gauss map sends the surface $\Sigma$ to the unit sphere $\SS^2$.
It can be always defined locally (that is in a neighborhood of a point);
if it can be defined globally, then the surface $\Sigma$ is called \emph{oriented}.

M\"obius band gives an example of nonoriented surface with boundary.
Klein bottle is an example of closed immerersed surface which is not oriented.
Any closed embedded surface is oriented since one can choose the  direction pointing outside of the region bounded by the surface.

Fix a point $p\in \Sigma$ and a smooth curve $\alpha$ in $\Sigma$ that starts at $p$;
that is $\alpha(0)=p$.
Set  $v=\alpha'(0)$ and $w=(\nu\circ\alpha)'(0)$.
Note that $v$ lie in $T_p$ --- the tangent plane at $p$.

Further $w\in \T_p$ as well.
Indeed $\nu\circ\alpha$ is a curve that starts at $\nu(p)$;
so $w=(\nu\circ\alpha)'(0)$ lies in the tangent plane $\T_{\nu(p)}\SS^2$.
But at $\nu(p)$, the sphere $\SS^2$ has normal $\nu(p)$ and therefore its tangent plane $\T_{\nu(p)}\SS^2$ is parallel $T_p$, so $\T_{\nu(p)}\SS^2$ and $T_p$ are identical as vector spaces.

Further note that since Gauss map is smooth,
the vector $w$ depends only on $v$;
that is if we choose a different curve $\alpha$ such that $v=\alpha'(0)$ we will get the same value $w=(\nu\circ\alpha)'(0)$.
The map $s_p\:v\mapsto w$ is called shape operator;
it maps the tangent plane $\T_p$ to itself.

It is straightforwardto check that the eigenvalues of $s_p$ are the principle curvatures at $p$; it agrees with the definition given above if the normal vector $\nu$ is chosen to point down in the specital graph representation $z=f(x,y)$.







The Gauss map can be defined (globally) if and only if the surface is orientable, in which case its degree is half the Euler characteristic. The Gauss map can always be defined locally (i.e. on a small piece of the surface). The Jacobian determinant of the Gauss map is equal to Gaussian curvature, and the differential of the Gauss map is called the shape operator.

\section{Tennis ball theorem}

Suppose that a curve $\alpha$ runs on the unit sphere 
\[\SS^2=\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{x^2+y^2+z^2=1}.\] 
Let us denote by $\alpha''(t)^\top$ the projection of vector $\alpha''(t)$ to the tanget plane of the sphere at $\alpha(t)$.

Assume $\alpha$ is a unit-speed curve.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:a'-pertp-a''}, $\alpha''(t)\perp\alpha'(t)$ and therefore $\alpha''(t)^\top\perp\alpha'(t)$.
If $w(t)$ denotes by the vector $\alpha'(t)$ rotated
counterclockwise by angle $\tfrac\pi2$ in the tangent plane to the sphere at $\alpha(t)$, then 
\[\alpha''(t)^\top=\kappa_\alpha(t)\cdot w(t)\]
for some real number $\kappa(t)$;
this number is called \emph{signed geodesic curvature of $\alpha$ at $t$}.

The geodesic curvature measures how $\alpha$ diverges from an equator --- the most straight curve on the curved $\SS^2$.

The following diagram shows a simple curve with positive curvature that intersects a line at points $p_1,\dots p_11$; these points appear on the curve in the same order, and on the line  in the order $p_5,p_3,p_1,p_2,p_4,p_7,p_9,p_{11},p_{10},p_8,p_6$; 
The following Exercise is about this pattern.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Suppose $\alpha$ is a simple smooth regular curve in the plane that crosses a line $\ell$ at the points $p_1,p_2,\dots p_n$.
Assume that the points $p_1,p_2,\dots p_n$ appear on $\alpha$ in the same order.
Then the order on $\ell$ can be obtained from the following sequence 
\[p_1,p_3,\dots,p_4 ,p_2\]
by shift last $k$ elements to the beginning, reverting the order in the tail starting from $(2\cdot k+1)$-th element and reverting the order of the obtained sequence if necessary.
\end{thm}





\parit{Proof; only-if part.} 
Without loss of generality we can assume that $D$ lies on that $D$ lies on the left side of $\alpha$.
If so,
the only-if part will follow if the curvature of $\alpha$ is nonnegative.

Assume contrary, that is $\kappa(t_0)<0$ for some $t_0$.
Then the tangent line $\ell$ strictly supports $\alpha$ at $t_0$ from left;
that is, $\ell$ pass thru $\\alpha(t_0)$ and runs in the interior of $D$ shortly before and after.
A line $\ell'\parallel \ell$ which lies slightly to the right from $\ell$ has a line segment with the ends in the interior of $D$ that crosses $\alpha$.
That is $D$ is not convex.

\parit{If part.} assume $D$ is not convex; that is there are two points $p$ and $q$ in $D$ such that the line segment $[pq]$ does not lie completely in $D$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that $p$ and $q$ lie in the interior of $D$.

Let $\ell$ be the line thru $p$ and $q$.
Note that $\alpha$ changes the side of $\ell$ at least 4 times;
moreover one can choose crossing points $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ that appear in the same order on the line and $\alpha$.













The total signed curvature of a smooth unit-speed curve $\alpha\:[a,b]\z\to\RR^2$ can be defined as the integral
\[\tsc\alpha=\int_{[a,b]}\kappa(t)\cdot dt.\]

It is straightforward to show that for sufficienlty fine partition of closed unit-speed curve $\alpha$ the inscribed polygonal line has the same total signed curvature.
Therefore by exercises~\ref{ex:2kpi} and \ref{ex:pm2pi},
we get that the total signed curvature of any closed simple curve is mutiple of $2\cdot\pi$ and if the curve is simple, it has to be $\pm2\cdot\pi$.
