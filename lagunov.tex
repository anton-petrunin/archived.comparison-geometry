Suppose $\gamma$ is a regular smooth curve in a smooth oriented surface $\Sigma$.
As usual we denote by $\Norm$ the unit normal field on $\Sigma$.

Without loss of generality we may assume that $\gamma$ is unit-speed;
in this case $\tan(s)=\gamma'(s)$ is its tangent indicatrix.
Let us use a shortcut notation $\Norm(s)=\Norm(\gamma(s))$.
Note that the unit vectors $\tan(s)$ and $\Norm(s)$ are orthogonal;
therefore there is a unique unit vector $\mu(s)$ such that 
$\tan(s),\mu(s),\nu(s)$ is an oriented orthonormal basis.
Since $\tan(s)\perp\nu(s)$, the vector $\mu(s)$ is tangent to $\Sigma$ at $\gamma(s)$.
In fact $\mu(s)$ is a counterclockwise rotation of $\tan(s)$ by right angle in the tangent plane $\T_{\gamma(s)}$.
This vector can be also defined as a vector product $\mu(s)=\nu(s)\times \tan(s)$. %???+PIC

Since $\gamma$ is unit-speed, we have that $\gamma''\perp \gamma'$; (see \ref{prop:a'-pertp-a''}).
Therefore the acceleration of $\gamma$ can be written as a linear combination of $\mu$ and $\Norm$;
that is,
\[\gamma''(s)=k_g(s)\cdot \mu(s)+k_n(s)\cdot\Norm(s).\]
The values $k_g(s)$ and $k_n(s)$ are called \emph{geodesic} and \emph{normal curvature} of $\gamma$ at $s$.
Since the frame $\tan(s),\mu(s),\nu(s)$ is orthonormal, these curvatures can be also written as the following scalar products:
\begin{align*}
k_g(s)&=\langle \gamma''(s),\mu(s)\rangle
=
\\
&=\langle \tan'(s),\mu(s)\rangle.
\\
k_n(s)&=\langle \gamma''(s),\Norm(s)\rangle=
\\
&=\langle \tan'(s),\Norm(s)\rangle.
\end{align*}

Since $0=\langle \tan(s),\Norm(s)\rangle$ we have 
that 
\begin{align*}
0&=\langle \tan(s),\Norm(s)\rangle=
\\
&=\langle \tan'(s),\Norm(s)\rangle+\langle \tan(s),\Norm'(s)\rangle=
\\
&=k_n(s)+\langle \tan(s),D_{\tan(s)}\nu\rangle.
\end{align*}
Applying \ref{prop:S=-D},  we get the following:

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:normal-shape}
Assume $\gamma$ is a smooth unit-speed curve in a smooth surface $\Sigma$.
Suppose $p=\gamma(s_0)$ and $\vec v=\gamma'(s_0)$.
Then 
\[k_n(s_0)=\langle S_p(\vec v),\vec v\rangle,\]
where $k_n$ denotes the normal curvature of $\gamma$ at $s_0$ and $S_p$ is the shape operator at $p$.
\end{thm}

Note that according to the proposition, the normal curvature of regular smooth curve in $\Sigma$ is completely determined by the velocity vector $\vec v$ at the point $p$.
By that reason the normal curvature is also denoted by $k_{\vec v}$;
according to the proposition,
\[k_{\vec v}=\langle S_p(\vec v),\vec v\rangle\]
for any unit vector $\vec v$ in $\T_p$.

Let $p$ be a point on a smooth surface $\Sigma$.
Assume we choose the tangent-normal coordinates at $p$ so that the Hessian matrix is diagonalized, we can assume that
\[M_p=\begin{pmatrix}
   k_1(p)
   &0
   \\
   0
   &k_2(p)
  \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Consider a vector ${\vec w}=(\begin{smallmatrix}a\\b
\end{smallmatrix})$ in the $(x,y)$-plane.
Then
\begin{align*}
\langle S(\vec w),\vec w\rangle
&=\langle M_p\cdot(\begin{smallmatrix}a\\b
\end{smallmatrix}),(\begin{smallmatrix}a\\b
\end{smallmatrix})\rangle=
\\
&=a^2\cdot k_1(p) +b^2\cdot k_2(p). 
\end{align*}
If ${\vec w}$ is unit, then $a^2+b^2=1$ which implies the following:

\begin{thm}{Observation}\label{obs:k1-k2}
For any point $p$ on an oriented smooth surface $\Sigma$,
the principle curvatures $k_1(p)$ and $k_2(p)$ are correspondingly minimum and maximum of the normal curvatures at $p$.
Moreover, if $\theta$ is the angle between a unit vector ${\vec w}\in\T_p$ and the first principle direction at $p$, then 
\[k_{\vec w}(p)=k_1(p)\cdot(\cos\theta)^2+k_2(p)\cdot(\sin\theta)^2.\]

\end{thm}

The last identity is called \emph{Euler's formula}.


\begin{thm}{Meusnier's theorem}\label{thm:meusnier}
Let $\gamma$ be a regular smooth curve that runs in a smooth oriented surface $\Sigma$.
Suppose $p=\gamma(t_0)$ and ${\vec v}\z=\gamma'(t_0)$ and $\alpha=\angle(\Norm(p),\norm(t_0))$;
that is, $\alpha$ is the angle between the unit normal to $\Sigma$ at $p$ and the unit normal vector in the Frenet frame of $\gamma$ at~$t_0$.
Then the following identity holds for the curvature $\kur(t_0)$ and the normal curvature $k_n(t_0)$ of $\gamma$ at $t_0$:  
\[\kur(t_0)\cdot\cos\alpha=k_{n}(t_0).\]

\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.} Since $\gamma''=\tan'=\kur\cdot \norm$, we get that
\begin{align*}
k_{n}(t_0)&=\langle\gamma'',\Norm\rangle=
\\
&=\kur(t_0)\cdot\langle\norm,\Norm\rangle=
\\
&=\kur(t_0)\cdot\cos\alpha.
\end{align*}

The theorem above, as well as the statement in the following exercise are proved by Jean Baptiste Meusnier \cite{meusnier}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:meusnier}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth surface, $p\in\Sigma$ and ${\vec v}\in \T_p\Sigma$ is a unit vector.
Assume that $k_{\vec v}(p)\ne 0$; that is, the normal curvature of $\Sigma$ at $p$ in the direction of ${\vec v}$ does not vanish.

Show that the osculating circles at $p$ of smooth regular curves in $\Sigma$ that run in the direction ${\vec v}$ sweep out a sphere $S$ with center $p+\tfrac1{k_{\vec v}}\cdot\Norm$ and radius $r=\tfrac1{|k_{\vec v}|}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:principle-revolution}

\]
are principle curvatures of $\Sigma$ at $(x(s),y(s),0)$ in the direction of parallel and meridian correspondingly.
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

\section*{Lagunov's example}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:moon-revolution}
Assume $V$ is a body in $\RR^3$ bounded by a smooth surface of revolution with principle curvatures at most 1 in absolute value.
Show that $V$ contains a unit ball.
\end{thm}

The following question is a 3-dimensional analog of the moon in a puddle problem (\ref{thm:moon}).

\begin{thm}{Question}\label{quest:lagunov}
Assume a set $V\subset \RR^3$ is bounded by a closed connected surface $\Sigma$ with 
principle curvatures bounded in absolute value by 1.
Is it true that $V$ contains a ball of radius 1?
\end{thm}

According to \ref{ex:moon-revolution}, the answer is ``yes'' for surfaces of revolution.
We also have ``yes'' for convex surfaces; see \ref{ex:convex-lagunov}.
It turns out that in general the answer is  ``no''.
The following example was constructed by Vladimir Lagunov \cite{lagunov}.


\parit{Construction.}
Let us start with a body of revolution $V_1$ with cross section shown on the diagram.
The boundary curve of the cross section consists of 6 long vertical line segments smoothly jointed into 3 closed simple curves. 
The boundary of $V_1$ has 3 components, each of which is a smooth sphere.

\begin{figure}[h!]%{r}{43 mm}
%\vskip-4mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-33}
\vskip0mm
\end{figure}

We assume that the curves have curvature at most 1.
Moreover with the exception for almost vertical parts, the curve have absolute curvature about 1 all the time.
The only thick part in $V$ is the place where all three boundary components come together;
the remaining part of $V$ is assumed to be very thin.
It could be arranged that the radius $r$ of the maximal ball in $V$ is just a little bit above 
$r_2=\tfrac2{\sqrt{3}}-1$.
($r_2$ is the radius of the smallest circle tangent to three unit circles that are tangent to each other.%+PIC???
)
In particular, we may assume that $r<\tfrac16$.

Exercise \ref{ex:principle-revolution} gives formulas for the principle curvatures of the boundary of $V$;
which imply that both principle curvatures are at most 1 by absolute value.  

It remains to modify $V_1$ to make its boundary connected without  alloing larger balls inside.

Note that each sphere in the boundary contains two flat discs;
they come into pairs closely lying to each other. 
Let us drill thru two of such pairs and reconnect the holes by another body of revolution whose 
axis is shifted but stays parallel to the axis of $V_1$.
Denote the obtained body by $V_2$; its cross section of the obtained body is shown on the diagram. 

Then repeat the operation for the other two pairs.
Denote the obtained body by $V_3$; the cross section of the obtained body is shown on the diagram.

Note that the boundary of $V_3$ is connected.
Assuming that the holes are large, its boundary can be made so that its principle curvatures are still at most $1$; the latter can be proved the same way as for~$V_1$.
\qeds


Note that the surface of $V_3$ in the Lagunov's example has genus 2;
that is, it can be parameterized by a sphere with two handles.

Indeed, the boundary of $V_1$ consists of three smooth spheres.

When we drill a hole, we make one hole in two spheres and two holes in one shpere.
We reconnect two spheres by a tube and obtain one sphere.
Connecting the two holes of the other sphere by a tube we get a torus;
it is on the right side on the picture of $V_2$.
That is, the boundary of $V_2$ is formed by one sphere and one torus.

To construct $V_3$ from $V_2$, we make a torus from the remaining sphere and connect it to the other torus by a tube.
This way we get a sphere with two handles; that is, it has genus 2.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:lagunov-genus4}
Modify Lagunov's construction to make the boundary surface a sphere with 4 handles.
\end{thm}

\section*{Variations*}

In this section we will discuss few results related to \ref{quest:lagunov}.

Recall that $r_2$ is the radius of the smallest circle tangent to three unit circles that are tangent to each other.
Let $r_3$
be the radius of the smallest sphere tangent to four unit spheres that are tangent to each other.
Direct calculations show that 
\[r_2=\tfrac2{\sqrt{3}}-1< \tfrac16\quad\text{and}\quad r_3=\sqrt{\tfrac32}-1>\tfrac15.\]

The following example shows that the bound obtained in the construction of the Lagunov's example is optimal.

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}\label{ex:thin}
Suppose a connected body $V\subset \RR^3$ is bounded by a finite number of closed smooth surfaces with principle curvatures bounded in absolute value by 1.
Assume that $V$ does not contain a ball of radius $r_2$.
Show that its boundary has two components of the same topological type; 
that is, both can be written in parametric form with the same parameter domain. 
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{33 mm}
\vskip-4mm

\includegraphics{mppics/pic-34}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

For example consider the region between two large concentric spheres with almost equal radiuses. 
This region can be made arbitrary thin and the curvature of the boundary can be made arbitrary close to zero.

Note that Lagunov's example shows that the estimate is sharp.

\begin{thm}{Very advanced exercise}\label{ex:PI-sphere}
Suppose a body $V\subset \RR^3$ is bounded by a smooth sphere with principle curvatures bounded in absolute value by 1.
Show that $V$ contains a ball of radius $r_3$.

Show that this bound is sharp; that is there are examples of $V$ as above that contain a ball of maximal radius arbitrary close to $r_3$
\end{thm}
