\section{Tame knots}

It is tricky to make a formal definition that captures the intuitive meaning of \emph{knot}.
An attempt to define knots as simple closed curves leads to a pathological examples as the one show on the diagram --- these are so called \emph{wild knots}.

If one adds that the curve has to be smooth and regular,
then these examples disappear, but it is still a tricky to give right definition of \emph{deformation} --- the following diagram shows 
\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=1]{pics/knot}

\end{figure}
that it can not be defined as a continuous family of closed simple smooth regular curves. 
Observe that all curves on the diagram are smooth and regular for all times including the last moment.

We define a \emph{knot} (more precicely \emph{tame knot}) to be a simple closed polygonal line in Euclidean space~$\RR^3$.

The notation $\triangle abc$ is used for triangle $abc$; that is a polygonal line with three edges and vertexes $a$, $b$ and $c$.
Let us denote by $\solidtriangle abc$ the convex hull of the points $a$, $b$ and $c$; $\solidtriangle abc$ is the solid triangle with the vertexes $a$, $b$ and $c$.
The points $a$, $b$ and $c$ are assumed to be distinct, but they might lie on one line;
that is for us a degenerate triangle is a triangle.

We understand a \emph{elementary deformation} of a knot to be the generation of a new knot from the original one by means of the
following two operations:

Assume $[pq]$ is an edge of the knot and $x$
is a point such that the solid triangle $\solidtriangle pqx$  has no common points with the knot except for the edge $[pq]$.
Then we can replace the edge $[pq]$ in the knot by two adjacent edges $[px]$ and $[xq]$.

We can also perform the inverse operation.
That is, if for two adjacent edges $[px]$ and $[xq]$ of a knot the triangle
$\solidtriangle pqx$ has no common points with the knot except for the points on the edges $[px]$ and $[xq]$,
then we can replace two adjacent edges $[px]$ and $[xq]$ by one edge $[pq]$.

Polygons that arise from one another by a finite sequence of
elementary deformations are called \emph{isotopic}.

A knot that is not isotopic to a triangle is called nontrivial.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:triangle-isotopy}
Let $x$ and $y$ be two points on the adjacent edges $[p_1p_2]$ and $[p_2p_3]$ of a knot $\beta=p_1p_2p_3\dots p_n$.
Assume that the solid triangle $\solidtriangle xp_2y$ intersects $\beta$ only along the $[xp_2]\cup [p_2y]$.
Show that the knot $\beta'=p_1xyp_3\dots p_n$ is isotopic to $\beta$.
\end{thm}



\section{Elementary proof of F\'ary--Milnor theorem}

Here we sketch a proof of F\'ary--Milnor theorem given by of Stephanie Alexander and Richard Bishop in \cite{alexander-bishop}.

The proof is elementary, but not simple 
(elementary does not mean simple, it means only that it does not use much theory).
It is based on the following two facts that we already familiar with:
\begin{itemize}
\item If a closed polygonal line $\beta'$ is inscribed in a closed polygonal line $\beta$ then 
 \[\tc\beta'\le \tc\beta.\]
\item The total curvature of doubly covered
bigon is $4\cdot\pi$; that is,
\[\tc\beta=4\cdot\pi\]
if $\beta=pqpq$ for two distinct points $p$ and $q$.
Similarly if a quadrilateral is sufficiently close to a doubly covered
bigon, then its total curvature is close to $4\cdot\pi$.
\end{itemize}


\parit{Proof.}
Let $\beta=p_1\dots p_n$ be a closed polygonal line that is not a trivial knot;
that is, one can not get a triangle from $\beta$ by applying a sequence of deformations defined in the previous section.

We proceed by induction on the number $n \ge 3$.
In the base case $n=3$ the polygonal line $\beta$ is a triangle.
Therefore, by the definition, $\beta$ is a trivial knot --- nothing to prove.

Consider the smallest $n$ for which the statement fail;
that is, there is a closed simple polygonal line $\beta\z=p_1\dots p_n$ that is not a trivial knot such that
\[\tc\beta<4\cdot\pi.
\eqlbl{eq:<4pi}\]
We use the indexes modulo $n$ that is $p_0=p_n$, $p_1=p_{n+1}$ and so on.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\beta$ is in general position; 
that is, no four vertexes of $\beta$ lie on one plane. 

Set $\beta_0=\beta$.
If the solid triangle $\solidtriangle p_{0}p_1p_{2}$ intersects $\beta_0$ only by the two adjacent edges,
then applying the corresponding triangular deformation, we get a knot $\beta'_0$ with $n-1$ edge that is inscribed in $\beta_0$ therefore
\[\tc\beta_0\ge \tc\beta_0'.\]
On the other hand by induction hypothesis 
\[\tc\beta_0'\ge 4\cdot\pi\]
which contradicts \ref{eq:<4pi}.

Choose the first point $w'_1$ on the edge $[p_1p_2]$ so that the line segment $[p_0w'_1]$ 
intersects $\beta_0$.
Denote a point of intersection by $y_1$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{25 mm}
\vskip-0mm

\includegraphics{mppics/pic-17}

\end{wrapfigure}

Choose a point $w_1$ on $[p_1p_2]$ a bit before $w'_1$
(below we explain how close).
Denote by $x_1$ the point on $[p_0w_1]$ that minimize the distance to $y_1$.
This way we get a closed polygonal line 
$\beta_1\z=w_1p_2\dots p_n$ with two marked points $x_1$ and $y_1$.
Denote by $m_1$ the number of edges in the arc $y_1w_1\dots x_1$ of $\beta_1$.

By Exercise~\ref{ex:triangle-isotopy}, $\beta_1$ is isotopic to $\beta_0$;
in particular $\beta_1$ is a nontrivial knot.

Now let us repeat the procedure for the adjacent edges $[w_1b_2]$ and $[b_2b_3]$ of $\beta_1$.
If the solid triangle $\solidtriangle w_1b_2b_3$ intersects $\beta_1$ only at these two adjacent edges, then we get a contradiction with the induction hypothesis the same way as before.
Otherwise we get a new knot $\beta_2=w_1w_2b_3\dots b_n$ with two marked points $x_2$ and $y_2$.
Denote by $m_2$ the number of edges in the broken line $y_2w_3\dots x_2$.

Note that the points $x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2$ can not appear on $\beta_2$ in the same cyclic order;
otherwise the broken line $x_1x_2y_1y_2$ can be made to be arbitrary close to a doubly covered bigon which again contradicts~\ref{eq:<4pi}.%
\footnote{More precisely, the choice of $w_1$ has to be made so that the distance $|x_1-y_1|$ would be much less that all the distances between $y_1$ and any point $z\in\beta\cap \solidtriangle p_1p_2p_3$, so we have
\[\measuredangle y_1zx_1<\tfrac\eps{10},\]
where $\eps=4\cdot\pi-\tc\beta$.
In this case, since $y_2\in \beta\cap \solidtriangle p_1p_2p_3$ and $x_2$ can be taken arbitrary close to $y_2$, we have
\[\tc x_1x_2y_1y_2 > 4\cdot\pi -\eps= \tc\beta\]
which can not happen since $x_1x_2y_1y_2$ is inscribed in $\beta$.}

Therefore we can assume that the arc $x_2w_2\dots y_2$ lies inside of arc $x_1w_1\dots y_1$ in $\beta_2$
and therefore $m_1>m_2$.

Continuing this procedure we get a sequence of polygonal lines $\beta_i\z=w_1\dots w_i p_{i+1}p_n$ with marked points $x_i$ and $y_i$ such that the number of edges $m_i$ from $x_i$ to $y_i$ decreases in $i$.
Clearly $m_i>1$ for any $i$ and $m_1<n$.
Therefore it requires less than $n$ steps we get a contradiction with the induction hypothesis.
