These notes designed for those who plan to do differential geometry,
or to have a solid ground not to do it in the future.

Differential geometry does geometry on top of several branches of mathematics including 
real analysis, 
measure theory,
calculus of variation,
differential equations,
elementary and convex geometry,
topology, and more.
This subject is wide even at the entrance. 
By that reason it is fun and pain to teach and to study.

We discuss smooth curves and surfaces --- the main gate to differential geometry.
This subject provides a collection of examples and ideas critical for further study.
It is wise to become a master in this subject before making further steps --- no need for a rush.

We give an idea about subject, keeping it elementary, visual, and virtually rigorous; we allow gaps that belong to other branches of mathematics (most of these subjects discussed briefly in the preliminaries).

We try to minimize the distance between definitions and meaningful results and impressive proof.
The highest points in these notes are
the theorem of Vladimir Ionin and Herman Pestov about closed curves with bounded curvature,
the theorem of Sergei Bernstein's on saddle graphs,
and the theorem of Stephan Cohn-Vossen on existence of simple two-sided infinite geodesic on an open convex surface.
These theorems give the first nontrivial examples of the so called {}\emph{local to global theorems} --- the hart of differential geometry. 

These notes are based on lectures at MASS program (Mathematics Advanced Study Semesters at Pennsylvania State University) Fall semester 2018.
Number of these topics were presented on the lectures of Yurii Burago who was teaching the first author at the Leningrad University.

We put emphasise on geometry.
We know of two other textbook that take similar approach: one is written by Aleksei Chernavskii \cite{chernavsky} and the other by Victor Toponogov~\cite{toponogov}.
