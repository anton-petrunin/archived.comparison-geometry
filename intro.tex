%The differential geometry of curves and surfaces is a classical subject that is introductory to differential %geometry.
%This subject provides a collection of examples critical for further study --- one has to become a master in %curves and surfaces before making further steps in differential geometry.

%Differential geometry does geometry on top of several branches of mathematics including real analysis, %differential equations, topology and few other branches of geometry, including elementary and convex geometry.
%The subject of differential geometry is huge and it is huge even on the introductory level. 
%By that reason it is fun and pain to study and to teach.
 
These notes contain a small part of lectures at MASS program (Mathematics Advanced Study Semesters at Pennsylvania State University) Fall semester 2018.

The notes are designed for those who plan to do differential geometry in the future,
or at least who want to have a solid ground to decide not to do it.
It gives an idea about subject and at the same time it is elementary rigorous and nontechnical.

The highest point is the theorem about the Moon in a puddle proved by Ionin and Pestov.
This is the first nontrivial example of the so called \emph{local to global theorems} which is the hart of differential geometry.



%The course include elementary topics that typically not considered in the introductory courses in differential %geometry;
%all these topics are grouped around comparison method which is hart of differential geometry.
%The course is designed for those who plan to do differential geometry in the future,
%or at least who want to have a solid ground to decide not to do it.



%The choice of subjects is taken mostly from the lectures of Yurii Burago who was teaching the first author at the Leningrad University.
%Among the other textbooks on the subject, we liked the book of Victor Toponogov \cite{toponogov}; however this book is more demanding from the students and instructors.

%We want to thank Domonic Mathews ...
