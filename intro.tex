The notes are designed for those who plan to do differential geometry in the future,
or at least who want to have a solid ground to decide not to do it.
We try to give an idea about subject, keeping it elementary and virtually rigorous, meaning that we allow gaps that belong to other branches of mathematics.

We discuss differential geometry of curves and surfaces.
It is the main gate to differential geometry;
this subject provides a collection of examples critical for further study.
In fact one has to become a master in curves and surfaces before making further steps in differential geometry.

Differential geometry does geometry on top of several branches of mathematics including real analysis, differential equations, topology and other branches of geometry, including elementary and convex geometry.
This subject is wide even on the introductory level. 
By that reason it is fun and pain to teach and to study.

All these topics are grouped around comparison method which is worth to learn at the very beginning.
We try to minimize the distance between definitions and meaningful results.
The lectures contain number of classical topics which typically not considered in the introductory courses.
We have two highest points: the theorem of Vladimir Ionin and Herman Pestov about closed curves with bounded curvature and the theorem of Sergei Bernstein's on saddle graphs.
These two theorems give the first nontrivial examples of the so called \emph{local to global theorems} which is the hart of differential geometry.

These notes are based on lectures at MASS program (Mathematics Advanced Study Semesters at Pennsylvania State University) Fall semester 2018.
Number of these topics were presented on the lectures of Yurii Burago who was teaching the first author at the Leningrad University.
For further study, we recommend the textbook of Victor Toponogov~\cite{toponogov}.
