\section*{Spherical image}


\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:spherical-image}
Let $\Sigma$ be an oriented proper surface without boundary and with positive Gauss curvature.
Then the spherical map $\Norm\:\Sigma\to\SS^2$ is injective and
\[\int_R K=\area[\Norm(R)]\]
for any region $R$ in $\Sigma$. %??? measurable
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} 
Fix two distinct points $p,q\in\Sigma$.
Recall that $\Sigma$ bounds a strictly convex region.
Therefore the $\Norm_p$ makes an obtuse angle with the line segment $[p,q]$. %??? why
The same way we can show that $\Norm_q$ makes an obtuse angle with the line segment $[q,p]$.
In other words the projections of $\Norm_p$ and $\Norm_q$ on the line $pq$ point in the opposite directions.
In particular $\Norm_p\ne \Norm_q$; that is, the spherical map is injective.

It remains to prove the identity.
Note that we can assume that the region $R$ is covered by one chart $(u,v)\mapsto s(u,v)$; if not cut $R$ into smaller regions and sum up the results.

Applying the definition of integral, we have the following expression for the left hand side
\[\int_R K \df \iint_{s^{-1}(R)} K[s(u,v)]\cdot |\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}(u,v)\times\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}(u,v)|  \cdot du\cdot dv.\]
Applying the definition of area, we have the following expression for the right hand side
\[\area[\Norm(R)] \df \iint_{s^{-1}(R)}  |\tfrac{\partial \Norm\circ s}{\partial v}(u,v)\times\tfrac{\partial \Norm\circ s}{\partial u}(u,v)|  \cdot du\cdot dv.\]
Therefore it is sufficient to show that 
\[\tfrac{\partial \Norm\circ s}{\partial v}(u,v)\times\tfrac{\partial \Norm\circ s}{\partial u}(u,v)=K[s(u,v)]\cdot \tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}(u,v)\times\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}(u,v)\eqlbl{eq:gauss-curv}\]
for any $(u,v)$ in the domain of definition. 

Fix a point $p=s(u,v)$.
Recall that 
\[\tfrac{\partial \Norm\circ s}{\partial u}=S_p(\tfrac{\partial  s}{\partial u})\quad\text{and}\quad\tfrac{\partial \Norm\circ s}{\partial v}=S_p(\tfrac{\partial  s}{\partial v}).\]
Therefore 
\[\tfrac{\partial \Norm\circ s}{\partial v}\times\tfrac{\partial \Norm\circ s}{\partial u}=\det S_p\cdot \tfrac{\partial s}{\partial v}\times\tfrac{\partial s}{\partial u}.\]
Since $K(p)=\det S_p$, \ref{eq:gauss-curv} follows.
