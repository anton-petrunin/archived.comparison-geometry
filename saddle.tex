\chapter{Supporting surfaces}

\section*{Definitions}

Assume two oriented surfaces $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ have a common point $p$.
If there is a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $\Sigma_1\cap U$ lies on one side from $\Sigma_2$ in $U$, then we say that $\Sigma_2$ \emph{locally supports} $\Sigma_1$ at $p$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:T=T}
Let $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ be two smooth surfaces.
Assume $\Sigma_2$ \emph{locally supports} $\Sigma_1$ at a point $p$.
Show that $\T_p\Sigma_1=\T_p\Sigma_2$;
that is, the tangent planes of $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ at $p$ coincide.
\end{thm}

By the exercise, we can assume that $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ are cooriented at $p$;
that is, they have common unit normal vector at $p$.
If not we can revert the orientation of one of the surfaces.

If $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ are cooriented at $p$,
then we can say that $\Sigma_1$ locally supports $\Sigma_2$ from \emph{inside} or from \emph{outside},
assuming that the normal vector points \emph{inside} the domain bounded by surface $\Sigma_2$ in $U$.

More precisely, we can use for $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ one tangent-normal coordinate system at $p$.
This way we write $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ locally as graphs: $z=f_1(x,y)$  and $z=f_2(x,y)$ correspondingly.
Then $\Sigma_1$ locally supports $\Sigma_2$ from inside (from outside)  if $f_1(x,y)\ge f_2(x,y)$ (correspondingly $f_1(x,y)\le f_2(x,y)$) for $(x,y)$ in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin.

Note that $\Sigma_1$ locally supports $\Sigma_2$ from inside at the point $p$ is equivalent to $\Sigma_2$ locally supports $\Sigma_1$ from outside.
Further if we revert the orientation of both surfaces then supporting from inside becomes supporting from outside and the other way around.


\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:surf-support}
Let $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ be oriented surfaces.
Assume $\Sigma_1$ locally supports $\Sigma_2$ from inside at the point $p$ (equivalently $\Sigma_2$ locally supports $\Sigma_1$ from outside).
Then 
\[k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}\quad\text{and}\quad k_2(p)_{\Sigma_1}\z\ge k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}.\]
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:surf-support}
Give an example of two surfaces $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ that have common point $p$ with common unit normal vector $\Norm_p$ such that 
$k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}> k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}$ and $k_2(p)_{\Sigma_1}\z> k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}$, but $\Sigma_1$ does not support $\Sigma_2$ locally at $p$.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.} We can assume that $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ are graphs $z=f_1(x,y)$  and $z=f_2(x,y)$ in a common tangent-normal coordinates at $p$, so we have $f_1\ge f_2$.

Fix a unit vector ${\vec w}\in \T_p\Sigma_1=\T_p\Sigma_2$.
Consider the plane $\Pi$ passing thru $p$ and spanned by the normal vector $\Norm_p$ and ${\vec w}$.
Let $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ be the curves of intersection of $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ with $\Pi$.

Let us orient $\Pi$ so that $\Norm_p$ points to the left from ${\vec w}$.
Further, let us parametrize both curves so that they are running in the direction of ${\vec w}$ at $p$ and therefore cooriented.
In this case the curve $\gamma_1$ supports the curve $\gamma_2$ from the right. %??? make \ref{prop:supporting-circline} once it is generalized


By \ref{prop:supporting-circline}, we have the following inequality for the normal curvatures of $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ at $p$ in the direction of ${\vec w}$:
\[k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_2}.\eqlbl{kw>=kw}\]

According to \ref{obs:k1-k2},
\[k_1(p)_{\Sigma_i}=\min\set{k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_i}}{{\vec w}\in\T_p, |{\vec w}|=1}\]
for $i=1,2$.
Choose ${\vec w}$ so that $k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}=k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_1}$.
Then by \ref{kw>=kw}, we have that
\begin{align*}
k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}&=k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge
\\
&\ge k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_2}\ge
\\
&\ge\min\set{k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_2}}{}=
\\
&=k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2};
\end{align*}
that is, $k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}$.

Similarly, by \ref{obs:k1-k2}, we have that
\[k_2(p)_{\Sigma_i}=\max\set{k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_i}}{}.\]
Let us fix ${\vec w}$ so that $k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}=k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_2}$.
Then 
\begin{align*}
k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}&=k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_2}\le
\\
&\le k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_1}\le
\\
&\le\max\set{k_{\vec w}(p)_{\Sigma_1}}{}=
\\
&=k_2(p)_{\Sigma_1};
\end{align*}
that is, $k_2(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}$.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:surf-support}
Let $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ be oriented surfaces.
Assume $\Sigma_1$ locally supports $\Sigma_2$ from inside at the point $p$.
Then
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item\label{cor:surf-support:mean} $H(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge H(p)_{\Sigma_2}$;
\item\label{cor:surf-support:gauss} If $k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}\ge 0$, then $K(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge K(p)_{\Sigma_2}$.
\end{enumerate}
 
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
By \ref{prop:surf-support}, we get that $k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}$ and $k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}\ge k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}$.
Therefore part (\ref{cor:surf-support:mean}) follows since 
\[H(p)_{\Sigma_i}=k_1(p)_{\Sigma_i}+k_2(p)_{\Sigma_i}.\]


\parit{(\ref{cor:surf-support:gauss}).} Since $k_2(p)_{\Sigma_i}\ge k_1(p)_{\Sigma_i}$ and $k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}\ge 0$, we get that all the principle curvatures 
$k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}$, 
$k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}$, 
$k_2(p)_{\Sigma_1}$, and 
$k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}$ are nonnegative.
By \ref{prop:surf-support}, it implies that
\begin{align*}
K(p)_{\Sigma_1}&=k_1(p)_{\Sigma_1}\cdot k_2(p)_{\Sigma_1}\ge 
\\
&\ge k_1(p)_{\Sigma_2}\cdot k_2(p)_{\Sigma_2}=
\\
&=K(p)_{\Sigma_2}.
\end{align*}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:positive-gauss}
Show that any closed surface in a unit ball has a point with Gauss curvature at least 1.
\end{thm}

\section*{Saddle surfaces}

A surface is called \emph{saddle} if its Gauss curvature at each point is nonpositive;
in other words principle curvatures at each point have opposite signs or one of them is zero.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{40 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{asy/saddle}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

If the Gauss curvature is negative at each point,
then the surface is called \emph{strictly saddle};
equivalently it means that the principle curvatures have opposite signs at each point.
Note that in this case the tangent plane does not support the surface even locally --- moving along the surface in the principle directions at a given point, one goes above and below the tangent plane at this point.  


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:convex-revolution}
Let $f\:\RR\to\RR$ be a smooth positive function.
Show that the surface of revolution of the graph $y\z=f(x)$ around the $x$-axis
 is saddle if and only if $f$ is convex; that is, if $f''(x)\ge0$ for any $x$.
\end{thm}

A surface $\Sigma$ is called \emph{ruled} if for every point $p\in \Sigma$ there is a line segment $\ell_p\subset \Sigma_p$ thru $p$ that is infinite or has its endpoint(s) on the boundary line of $\Sigma$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:ruled=>saddle}
Show that any ruled surface $\Sigma$ is saddle.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Suppose $\Sigma$ is an open saddle surface.
Show that for any point $p\in \Sigma$ there is a curve $\gamma\:[0,\infty)\to\Sigma$ that starts at $p$ and monotonically escapes to infinity;
that is, $t\mapsto|\gamma(t)|$ is an increasing function and $|\gamma(t)|\to\infty$ as $t\to\infty$.
\end{thm}

A tangent direction on a smooth surface with vanishing normal curvature is called \emph{asymptotic}.
A smooth regular curve that always runs in an asymptotic direction is called an asymptotic line
\index{asymptotic line}\emph{asymptotic line}.\label{page:asymptotic line}

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}
Let $\Sigma\subset \RR^3$ be the graph $z\z=f(x,y)$
of a smooth function $f$ 
and $\gamma$ be a closed smooth asymptotic line in $\Sigma$.
Assume $\Sigma$ is strictly saddle in a neighborhood of $\gamma$.
Show that the projection of $\gamma$ to the $(x, y)$-plane cannot be star-shaped.
\end{thm}

\section*{Hats}

Note that a closed surface cannot be saddle.
Indeed consider a smallest sphere that contains a closed surface $\Sigma$ inside;
it supports $\Sigma$ at some point $p$ and at this point the principle curvature must have the same sign.
The following more general statement  is proved using the same idea.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:convex-saddle}
Assume $\Sigma$ is a compact saddle surface and its boundary line lies in a convex closed region $R$.
Then $\Sigma\subset R$.
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{50 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-73}
\vskip0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume contrary; that is, there is point $p\in \Sigma$ that does not lie in $R$.
Let $\Pi$ be a plane that separates $p$ from $R$; it exists by \ref{lem:separation}.
Denote by $\Sigma'$ the part of $\Sigma$ that lies with $p$ on the same side from $\Pi$.

Since $\Sigma$ is compact, it is surrounded by a sphere $S$;
let $\sigma$ be the circle of intersection of $S$ and $\Pi$.
Consider the smallest spherical dome $\Sigma_0$ with boundary $\sigma$ that includes $\Sigma'$.

Note that $\Sigma_0$ supports $\Sigma$ at some point~$q$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that $\Sigma_0$ and $\Sigma$ are cooriented at $q$ and $\Sigma_0$ has positive principle curvatures.
In this case $\Sigma_0$ supports $\Delta$ from outside.
By \ref{cor:surf-support}, $K(q)_\Sigma\ge K(q)_{\Sigma_0}>0$ --- a contradiction.
\qeds

Note that if we assume that $\Sigma$ is strictly saddle, then we could arrive to a contradiction by taking a point $q$ on the same side with $p$ and on the maximal distance from $\Pi$.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:length-of-bry}
Let $\Delta$ be a smooth regular saddle disc and $p\in \Delta$.
Assume that the boundary line $\partial \Delta$ lies in the unit sphere centered at~$p$.
Show that $\length (\partial \Delta)\ge 2\cdot\pi$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:circular-cone-saddle}
Show that an open saddle surface
cannot lie inside of an infinite circular cone. 
\end{thm}

A disc $\Delta$ in a surface $\Sigma$ is called a \emph{hat} of $\Sigma$
if its boundary line $\partial\Delta$ lies in a plane $\Pi$ and the remaining points of $\Delta$ lie on one side of $\Pi$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:hat}
A smooth surface $\Sigma$ is saddle if and only if it has no hats.
\end{thm}

Note that a saddle surface can contain a closed plane curve.
For example the hyperboloid $x^2+y^2-z^2=1$ contains the unit circle in the $(x,y)$-plane centered at the origin.
However, a plane curve cannot bound a disc (as well any compact set) in a saddle surface.

\parit{Proof.}
Since plane is a convex set, the ``only if'' part follows from \ref{lem:convex-saddle};
it remains to prove the ``if'' part.

Assume $\Sigma$ is not saddle; that is, it has a point $p$ with strictly positive Gauss curvature;
or equivalently, the principle curvatures $k_1(p)$ and $k_2(p)$ have the same sign.

Let $z=f(x,y)$ be a graph representation of $\Sigma$ in the tangent-normal coordinates at $p$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that both principle curvatures are positive,
or equivalently the 
\[D^2_wf(0,0)=\II_p(w,w)>0\] 
for any unit tangent vector $w\in\T_p\Sigma$ (which is the $(x,y)$-plane).

Since the set of unit vectors is compact, we have that 
\[D^2_wf(0,0)>\eps\]
for some fixed $\eps>0$ and any unit tangent vector $w\in\T_p\Sigma$.
By continuity of the function $(x,y,w)\mapsto D^2_wf(x,y)$,
we have that $D^2_wf(x,y)>0$ for $(x,y)$ in a neighborhood of the origin.
That is, $f$ is a strictly convex function in a neighborhood of the origin in the $(x,y)$-plane.
In particular the set 
\[\Delta_\eps=\set{(x,y,f(x,y))\in \RR^3}{f(x,y))\le \eps}\]
is a disc for sufficiently small $\eps>0$ (see \ref{ex:disc-hat}).
Note that its boundary line lies on the plane $z=\eps$ and whole disc lies below it;
that is, $\Delta_\eps$ is a hat.
\qeds

Note that we proved the following lemma; it will be useful later. %??? move in curvature

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:gauss+=>convexity}
Let $z=f(x,y)$ be the local description of a smooth surface $\Sigma$ in a tangent-normal coordinates at some point $p\in\Sigma$.
Assume both principle curvatures of $\Sigma$ are positive at $p$.
Then the function $f$ is strictly convex in a neighborhood of the origin.
\end{thm}

In the proof above we assumed that the statement in following exercise is evident.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:disc-hat}
Let $\Delta_\eps$ be as in the proof above.
Show that $\Delta_\eps$ is a smooth disc; that is, $\Delta_\eps$ is the image of regular embedding $\DD\to \RR^3$, where $\DD=\set{(x,y)\in\RR^2}{x^2+y^2\le 1}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:saddle-linear}
Let $T\:\RR^3\to\RR^3$ be a linear transformation; that is, $T(x,y,z)=(x,y,z)\cdot A$ for an invertible $3{\times}3$-matrix $A$. 
Show that for any saddle surface $\Sigma$ the image $T(\Sigma)$ is also a saddle surface.
\end{thm}

\section*{Saddle graphs}

The following theorem was proved by Sergei Bernstein \cite{bernstein}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:bernshtein}
Let $f\:\RR^2\to\RR$ be a smooth function.
Assume its graph $z=f(x,y)$ is a strictly saddle surface in $\RR^3$.
Then $f$ is not bounded;
that is, there is no constant $C$ such that 
$|f(x,y)|\le C$ for any $(x,y)\in\RR^2$.
\end{thm}

Before going into the proof let us discuss some examples.

Note that the theorem states that a saddle graph cannot lie between parallel horizontal planes;
applying \ref{ex:saddle-linear} we get that saddle graphs cannot lie between parallel planes,
not necessarily horizontal.
The following exercise shows that the theorem does not hold for saddle surfaces which are not graphs.


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:between-parallels}
Construct an open strictly saddle surface that lies between parallel planes.
\end{thm}


The following exercise shows that there are saddle graphs with functions bounded on one side; that is, both (upper and lower) bounds are needed in the proof of Bernshtein's theorem.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:one-side-bernshtein}
Show that there are positive functions with strictly saddle graphs.
In fact the graph
$z=\exp(x-y^2)$
is strictly saddle.
\end{thm}

Note that according to \ref{lem:convex-saddle}, there are no proper saddle surfaces in a parallelepiped that boundary line lies on one of its faces.
The following lemma gives an analogous statement for a parallelepiped with an infinite side.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:region}
There is no proper strictly saddle smooth surface 
with the boundary line in a plane
that lies on bounded distance from a line.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
Note that in a suitable coordinate system, the statement can be reformulated the following way:
\emph{There is no proper strictly saddle smooth surface 
with the boundary line in the $(x,y)$-plane
that lies in a region of the following form:}
\[R=\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{0\le z\le r, 0\le y\le r}.\]
Further we will prove this statement.

Assume contrary, let $\Sigma$ be such a surface.
Consider the projection $\hat \Sigma$ of $\Sigma$ to the $(x,z)$-plane.
It lies in the upper half-plane and below the line $z=r$.

Consider the open upper half-plane $H=\set{(x,z)\in \RR^2}{z> 0}$. 
Let $\Theta$ be the connected component of the complement $H\backslash \hat \Sigma$ that contains all the points above the line $z=r$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-74}
\vskip0mm
\end{figure}

Note that $\Theta$ is convex.
If not then a line segment $[pq]$ for some $p,q\in \Theta$ cuts from $\hat\Sigma$ a compact piece.
Consider the plane $\Pi$ thru $[pq]$ that is perpendicular to the $(x,z)$-plane.
Note that $\pi$ cuts from $\Sigma$ a compact region $\Delta$.
By general position argument \ref{lem:reg-section}, 
we can assume that $\Delta$ is a compact surface with boundary line in $\Pi$ and the remaining part of $\Delta$ lies on one side from $\Pi$.
Since the plane $\Pi$ is convex, this statement contradicts \ref{lem:convex-saddle}.

Summarizing, $\Theta$ is an open convex set of $H$ that contains all points above $z=r$.
By convexity, together with any point $w$, the set $\Theta$ contains all points on the half-lines that point up from it. 
Whence it contain all points with $z$-coordinate larger than the $z$-coordinate of $w$.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-75}
\vskip0mm
\end{figure}
Since $\Theta$ is open it can be described by inequality $z>r_0$.
It follows that the plane $z=r_0$ supports $\Sigma$ at some point (in fact at many points).
By \ref{prop:surf-support}, the latter is impossible --- a contradiction.
\qeds

\parit{Proof of \ref{thm:bernshtein}.}
Denote by $\Sigma$ the graph $z=f(x,y)$.
Assume contrary; that is, $\Sigma$ lies between two planes $z=\pm C$.

Note $f$ cannot be constant.
It follows that the tangent plane $\T_p$ at some point $p\in\Sigma$ is not horizontal.

Denote by $\Sigma^+$ the part of $\Sigma$ that lies above $\T_p$.
Note that it has at least two connected components which are approaching $p$ from both sides 
in the principle direction with positive principle curvature.
Indeed if there would be a curve that runs in $\Sigma^+$ and approaches $p$ from both sides then it would cut a disc from $\Sigma$ with boundary line above $\T_p$ and some points below it;
the latter contradicts \ref{lem:convex-saddle}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-76}
\caption*{The surface $\Sigma$ seeing from above.}
\vskip0mm
\end{figure}

Summarizing, $\Sigma^+$ has at least two connected components, denote them by $\Sigma^+_0$ and $\Sigma^+_1$.
Let $z=h(x,y)=a\cdot x+b\cdot y+c$ be the equation of $\T_p$.
Note that $\Sigma^+$ contains all points in the region
\[R_-=\set{(x,y,f(x,y))\in\Sigma}{h(x,y)< C}\] 
which is a connected set and no points in 
\[R_+=\set{(x,y,f(x,y))\in\Sigma}{h(x,y)> C}\]
Whence one of the connected components, say $\Sigma^+_0$, lies in 
\[R_0=\set{(x,y,f(x,y))\in\Sigma}{|h(x,y)|\le  C}.\]
This set lies on a bounded distance from the line of intersection of $\T_p$ with the $(x,y)$-plane.

Moving the plane $\T_p$ slightly upward, we can cut from $\Sigma^+_0$ is a proper surface with boundary line lying in this plane (see \ref{lem:reg-section}).
The obtained surface is still on a bounded distance to a line
which is impossible by \ref{lem:region}.
\qeds

The following exercise gives a condition that guarantees that a saddle surface is a graph;
it can be used in combination with Bernshtein's theorem.

\begin{thm}{Advanced exercise}
Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth saddle disk in $\RR^3$.
Assume that the orthogonal projection to the $(x,y)$-plane
maps the boundary line of $\Sigma$
injectively to a convex closed curve.
Show that the orthogonal projection to the $(x,y)$-plane is injective on $\Sigma$.

In particular, $\Sigma$ is the graph $z=f(x,y)$ of a function $f$ defined on a convex figure in the $(x,y)$-plane.
\end{thm}


\section*{Remarks}

Note that Bernstein's theorem and the lemma in its proof do not hold for saddle surfaces;
counterexamples can be found among infinite cylinders over smooth regular curves.
In fact it can be shown that these are the only counterexamples;
a proof is based on the same idea, but more technical.

By \ref{prop:hat}, saddle surfaces can be defined as smooth surfaces without hats.
This definition can be used for arbitrary surfaces, not necessarily smooth.
Some results, for example Bernshtein's characterization of saddle graphs can be extended to generalized saddle surfaces, but this class of surfaces is far from being understood.
Some nontrivial properties were proved by Samuil Shefel \cite{shefel}; see also \cite[Capter 4]{akp}.
